# ⚡ QUICK START - Scoop Competitive Intelligence

**Read Time**: 2 minutes  
**Purpose**: Instant context for sales calls, demos, and competitive battles  

## 🎯 The One-Liner
**"Scoop is the only analytics platform with an investigation engine that finds root causes in 30 seconds, while competitors just run single queries and cost 50-400x more."**

## 🔥 The 30-Second Pitch

Traditional analytics tools are query engines - they answer WHAT but not WHY:
- **Question**: "Why did revenue drop?"
- **Them**: "Revenue was $X" (useless)
- **Scoop**: "Revenue dropped due to payment gateway failures affecting enterprise accounts starting Tuesday. $430K is recoverable. Here's how to fix it."

We investigate with 3-10 intelligent queries. They run one query and stop.

## 💰 The Cost Bomb

| Who | What You Pay | What They Don't Tell You |
|-----|--------------|-------------------------|
| **Scoop** | $299/month flat | Everything included |
| **Snowflake Cortex** | $1.6M/year | Per-query charges + compute + 2 FTEs |
| **ThoughtSpot** | $140K/year | Plus $100K implementation |
| **Tableau Pulse** | $165K/year | Requires full Tableau |
| **DataGPT** | $60K/year | Single data source only |

## 🚀 The Speed Difference

**Getting first insight:**
- **Scoop**: 30 seconds (during your call)
- **Snowflake Cortex**: 3-4 months (semantic models + custom dev)
- **ThoughtSpot**: 2-4 weeks (implementation)
- **Others**: 1-2 weeks minimum

**Daily workflow:**
- **Scoop**: "Create my board deck" → 30 seconds → Done
- **Others**: Query → Export → Excel → PowerPoint → 3.5 hours

## 🎪 The Demo Script

### Demo 1: The Investigation (1 minute)
```
"Why did customer churn increase?"

Scoop investigates:
✓ Analyzing churn patterns...
✓ Testing 6 hypotheses...
✓ Found correlation with support response time
✓ Identified product usage threshold
✓ Discovered billing error pattern
→ "Churn increased 23% due to support responses >4 hours 
   AND usage <10 hours/month AND billing errors. 
   It's the three-way interaction. Fix any two factors 
   to reduce churn by 71%."

Competitor output:
"Churn rate is 5.2%"
```

### Demo 2: The Excel Magic (30 seconds)
```excel
=SCOOP("What drives customer upgrades?")
```
Updates automatically. No export/import. Lives in Excel.

### Demo 3: The PowerPoint Miracle (30 seconds)
```
"@Scoop create my board presentation on Q4 performance"
[30 seconds later]
"Ready: 15-slide deck with insights, charts, and recommendations"
```

## 🛡️ The Objection Killers

### "We have Tableau/Power BI"
"Great for dashboards. But can it investigate WHY metrics change? Can business users use it without training? That's the difference between reporting and intelligence."

### "We're invested in Snowflake"
"Perfect! We make Snowflake valuable to business users, not just engineers. We query it better than Cortex, 400x cheaper, without semantic models."

### "We need enterprise security"
"SOC 2 Type II, SSO, read-only connections. More secure than building custom apps like Cortex requires."

### "Too good to be true"
"Schedule a 15-minute demo. We'll connect to your data and solve a real problem during the call."

## 🎯 Battleground Cheat Sheet

### vs Snowflake Cortex
- **They need**: 3-4 months, semantic models, custom Slack bot
- **Hidden cost**: $1.6M/year with per-query charges
- **Fatal flaw**: No ML, just text-to-SQL

### vs DataGPT
- **They're good at**: Fast queries
- **Limitation**: Single data source only
- **Missing**: Excel, PowerPoint, investigation
- **Your win**: "Great for simple questions, but you need more"

## 📱 The Talk Track

### For CEOs
"Your team spends 20 hours/week creating reports instead of finding insights. Scoop gives them answers in 30 seconds. Would you rather pay $299/month or $140K/year for that?"

### For CFOs  
"Current analytics: $200K-$1.6M/year. Scoop: $3,588/year. Same capabilities, 50-400x less cost. The ROI is immediate."

### For Sales Leaders
"Your reps can analyze win/loss patterns without asking anyone for help. In Slack. In seconds. While on customer calls."

### For Data Teams
"We don't replace you. We free you from ticket hell. Business users self-serve, you do strategic work."

## 🚨 Red Flags in Competitors

Watch for these tells:
- **"Semantic layer required"** = 3-month project
- **"LLM-powered"** = Just generates SQL
- **"Natural language interface"** = Still need training
- **"Self-service analytics"** = IT builds, users view
- **"AI insights"** = Basic statistics
- **"Predictive analytics"** = Black box models

## ⚡ The Close

"Look, you have three options:
1. Keep your current tool and waste 20 hours/week on reports
2. Buy a competitor for $140K+ and wait 3 months for setup
3. Try Scoop for 30 days risk-free and get insights today
