# Research Progress Tracker

**Started**: January 28, 2025  
**Status**: Active research ongoing

## Current Status

**Tableau Pulse**: 90% complete (needs screenshots only)  
**Power BI Copilot**: 40% complete (needs finishing)  
**Next**: Start ThoughtSpot (Tier 3 - real competition)

## Research Completed

| Competitor | Status | Key Finding | Evidence | Date |
|------------|---------|-------------|-----------|------|
| Tableau Pulse | 90% Complete | No ML, just alerts, requires IT, $165K/year | Full analysis, needs screenshots | 2025-01-28 |
| Power BI Copilot | 85% Complete | DAX generator for analysts, requires $54K+/year, not self-service | Full analysis, needs screenshots | 2025-01-28 |
| Qlik Insight Advisor | 85% Complete | Rule-based, breaks on typos/plurals, zero adoption | Full analysis, needs screenshots | 2025-01-28 |
| ThoughtSpot | 85% Complete | Real AI but $140K+/year, 2-4 weeks setup | Full analysis, needs screenshots | 2025-01-28 |
| Tellius | 85% Complete | Real root cause AI but $100K+, needs data team | Full analysis, needs screenshots | 2025-01-28 |
| Zenlytic | 85% Complete | YAML/SQL config required, fake "self-service" | Full analysis, needs screenshots | 2025-01-28 |
| DataGPT | 85% Complete | REAL AI + accessible (Tier 2 competitor!) | Full analysis, needs screenshots | 2025-01-28 |
| DataChat | 85% Complete | AI pretender, no reviews after 7 years | Full analysis, needs screenshots | 2025-01-28 |

## Key Patterns Confirmed

**Tier 1 "AI Pretenders" (4 Researched)**:
- NO real ML/AI capabilities (just rules, alerts, or NLP-to-formula)
- Tools for BI TEAMS not business users (all require technical knowledge)
- Generate formulas/charts not insights (DAX, dashboards, visualizations)
- Require portals not Slack (Qlik's integration broken, others portal-only)
- Need IT setup and training (weeks to months, constant maintenance)
- High failure rates (Qlik has ZERO real adoption per consultants)
- Massive costs hidden ($54K-$340K/year for 200 users)

**Tier 3 "Real AI Competition" (3 Researched)**:
- REAL ML/AI capabilities (clustering, root cause, anomaly detection)
- BUT requires data teams and technical expertise
- Enterprise pricing ($100K-$300K+/year)
- 2-4 weeks to 6 months implementation
- Business users still can't self-serve
- High abandonment rates (only 10-20% adoption)

**NEW FINDING - Tier 2 "Accessible AI" (1 Found)**:
- DataGPT has REAL AI + business user accessibility
- 85% adoption rate with natural language
- BUT: More expensive ($1-2K/month) and less ML than Scoop
- Validates conversational analytics market
- Shows execution matters as much as technology

**Scoop's Unique Position**:
- REAL ML + Investigation engine (like Tier 3)
- AND true business user self-service (like DataGPT)
- PLUS Slack integration, broader ML, lower cost
- Best combination of capability + accessibility

## Time Investment

| Date | Competitor | Hours | Key Activities |
|------|------------|-------|----------------|
| 2025-01-28 | Setup | 2.0 | Created research framework |
| 2025-01-28 | Tableau Pulse | 0.75 | Complete analysis |
| 2025-01-28 | Power BI Copilot | 1.0 | Complete analysis with dual focus |
| 2025-01-28 | Qlik Insight Advisor | 1.0 | Complete analysis, zero adoption finding |

**Total Hours**: 12+

## Next Actions for New Session

### Immediate Priorities
1. Get screenshots for all 85% complete competitors
2. Research high-priority missing competitors:
   - Sisense (likely Tier 1)
   - Domo (likely Tier 1)
   - MicroStrategy (likely Tier 1)
3. Complete Tier 3 research:
   - Databricks
   - Alteryx
   - Palantir Foundry

### Documentation Needs
1. Create output deliverables:
   - Executive landscape table (1-page summary)
   - Individual battle cards for top 5-6 competitors
   - Tiered comparison sheets
2. Update feature comparison matrix with DataGPT findings
3. Create quick reference guide for sales

### Key Reminders
- DataGPT is NOT a major threat (missing 90% of Scoop features)
- Continue documenting BOTH technical capabilities AND business user accessibility
- Focus on evidence-based findings with source documentation
- Every competitor needs 15-20 thorough source documents
