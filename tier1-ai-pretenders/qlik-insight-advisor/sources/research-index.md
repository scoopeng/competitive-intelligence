## Key Findings

### From Official Sources
1. **Complex Business Logic**: Requires IT expertise, not self-service
2. **Natural Language Limited**: English only, 100K value limit, exact syntax
3. **3-6 Month Implementation**: Not "quick" as marketed
4. **Desktop Killed**: Only cloud/SaaS supported now
5. **Disables AI Learning**: Business logic turns OFF machine learning
6. **Frequent Errors**: "Invalid Business Logic" after any data change

### From Community Sources
1. **Near-Zero Adoption**: Consultants find no production usage
2. **80%+ Failure Rate**: AI/BI pilots consistently fail
3. **Hours to Days Wasted**: Configuration attempts abandoned
4. **Infinite Loading**: Common technical failure
5. **Checkbox Feature**: Used for RFPs, not real work
6. **Competitor Success**: Others succeeded where Qlik failed

## Critical Evidence
- Direct quotes from users about failures
