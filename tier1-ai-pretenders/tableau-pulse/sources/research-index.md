## Key Findings So Far

### From Official Sources
1. **No Real AI/ML**: Uses pattern matching, explicitly avoids LLMs
2. **Cloud-Only**: Forces expensive migration from on-premise
3. **Complex Setup**: Requires published data sources, time dimensions, proper permissions
4. **Not Self-Service**: Business users need IT for everything
5. **Hidden Costs**: True cost 3-5x license fees with implementation
6. **Enterprise Pattern**: All examples are large companies with BI teams

### Critical Evidence Still Needed
- User testimonials showing actual experience
- Screenshots of errors and limitations
- Video evidence of setup complexity
- Forum posts about common problems
- Performance degradation evidence
- Adoption failure stories

## Next Steps
1. Analyze review sites for user reality
2. Mine community forums for pain points
3. Capture technical limitation evidence
4. Document real user workflows
5. Find adoption/abandonment rates
