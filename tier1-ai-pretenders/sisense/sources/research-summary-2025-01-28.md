# Sisense Research Summary
**Date**: January 28, 2025
**Sources Analyzed**: 15+
**Research Time**: 2 hours

## Executive Summary
Sisense is a traditional embedded BI platform with basic statistical features marketed as "AI." Despite claims of being "accessible to every user," it requires extensive technical implementation, data modeling, and developer resources. Real costs range from $21K-$167K annually with hidden fees and 400% renewal increases reported.

## Key Discoveries

### 1. Fake AI Reality
- Only has ARIMA forecasting (1970s statistics) and basic clustering
- "AI-agnostic architecture" = doesn't have AI built-in
- Must send data to cloud for basic "ML" processing
- No investigation engine, root cause analysis, or advanced ML

### 2. Not for Business Users
- Requires data modeling and Elasticube architecture
- 14+ week implementations common
- Steep learning curve even for basic use
- Everything through embedded apps (developers build, users consume)

### 3. True Cost Shock
- Minimum $21K/year for 5 users (cloud)
- Average enterprise: $50K-$137K/year
- Implementation: $10K-$50K additional
- Multi-tenant: $10K per Elasticube
- 400% renewal increases reported

### 4. Technical Complexity
- Elasticube failures with large data
- Requires infrastructure team
- Complex joins need manual configuration
- Best for "larger companies with dedicated analytics teams"

## Evidence Collection

### Marketing vs Reality
| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| "AI-powered analytics" | ARIMA forecasting + chat |
| "Accessible to every user" | Requires extensive training |
| "No-surprise pricing" | Hides all prices, 400% increases |
| "Effortless" | 14+ week implementations |

### User Experience Reality
- "Sisense can be complex, which leads to longer training times, slower user adoption"
- "Business users may find the learning curve steep unless data models are already curated"
- "Encountering Elasticube build failures...is an area that I believe Sisense can really improve"

### Pricing Manipulation
- 85% "discounts" off inflated list prices
- Bait-and-switch renewal tactics
- OEM pricing completely opaque
- Hidden costs for training, support, upgrades

## Competitive Positioning

### Why Scoop Wins
1. **Real ML vs Basic Stats**: Scoop has investigation engine, Sisense has ARIMA
2. **30 seconds vs 14 weeks**: Instant value vs extended implementation
3. **$3,588 vs $50,000+**: 90%+ cost savings
4. **Self-service vs IT dependency**: Business users empowered vs waiting
5. **Slack-native vs Portal prison**: Work where users work

### Discovery Questions
1. "How long did your Sisense implementation take?"
2. "Can business users create their own analyses?"
3. "What happens when Elasticubes fail?"
4. "What was your renewal price increase?"
5. "How many people manage your Sisense environment?"

## Next Research Steps
- [ ] Get screenshots of Elasticube failures
- [ ] Find more renewal price increase stories
- [ ] Document implementation timeline examples
- [ ] Capture complexity of developer documentation

## Conclusion
Sisense perfectly exemplifies a Tier 1 "AI Pretender" - traditional BI with statistical features marketed as AI, requiring extensive technical resources while claiming accessibility. Their embedded analytics focus means business users never truly self-serve, just consume what IT builds for them.
