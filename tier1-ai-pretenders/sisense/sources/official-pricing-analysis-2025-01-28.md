**URL**: https://www.sisense.com/pricing/
**Type**: Official Pricing Page
**Date Accessed**: 2025-01-28

## Key Findings Summary
MAJOR RED FLAG: No published pricing. Only a vague promise of "no-surprise pricing" with requirement to contact sales for custom quotes. This is the classic enterprise software pattern indicating high costs, complex negotiations, and lengthy sales cycles.

## Detailed Analysis

### Pricing Reality
- **What they show**: Nothing. Zero pricing information.
- **What they say**: "We work with you to create a customized solution"
- **Translation**: Enterprise sales process, negotiate everything, high costs

### Key Quote That Says Everything
> "Sisense is committed to 'no-surprise' pricing. We work with you to create a customized solution that specifically meets your needs and fits your budget, whatever your use case."

**Decoded**: 
- "No-surprise pricing" while hiding ALL prices = ironic
- "Customized solution" = complex scoping engagement
- "Fits your budget" = they'll charge what you can afford
- "Whatever your use case" = different prices for different customers

### Hidden Cost Indicators
- Form requires company details = they research your ability to pay
- "Request a custom quote" = sales qualification process
- "Schedule a demo" = multi-call sales cycle
- No starter/SMB options visible = enterprise-only

### Business User Implications
1. Cannot start without IT/procurement involvement
2. Requires budget approval process
3. Long sales cycle before any value
4. No self-service signup possible
5. Implementation costs likely on top

### Competitive Intelligence
- Competitors with public pricing: More SMB friendly
- Competitors hiding pricing: Similar enterprise focus
- This confirms Sisense targets large enterprises only
- Likely $50K+ annually based on similar platforms

### Red Flags/Concerns
1. Complete pricing opacity = high cost certainty
2. "Custom solution" = consulting/implementation fees
3. No trial mentioned = commitment required upfront
4. Form-gated information = aggressive sales follow-up
5. "No-surprise" claim while hiding prices = deceptive

### Evidence Needed
- [ ] Reviews mentioning actual costs
- [ ] Job postings showing deal sizes
- [ ] Competitor comparisons with pricing
- [ ] Implementation timeline/cost examples
- [ ] Minimum seat requirements

### Cross-Reference Notes
- Identical pattern to ThoughtSpot, Tellius (Tier 3)
- Unlike Scoop's transparent $299/seat pricing
- Confirms enterprise-only positioning
- Validates Tier 1 hypothesis (complex despite "AI" claims)
