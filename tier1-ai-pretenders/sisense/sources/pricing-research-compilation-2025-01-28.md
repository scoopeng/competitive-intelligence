# Sisense Pricing Research - Complete Analysis
**URL**: Multiple sources (Embeddable, UseDataBrain, Qrvey, Holistics, Reddit, AWS Marketplace)
**Type**: Pricing Intelligence Compilation
**Date Accessed**: 2025-01-28

## Key Findings Summary
Sisense pricing is deliberately opaque with massive variation ($14K-$167K annually). Real-world costs far exceed initial quotes, with implementation adding $10K-$50K+ and hidden costs like Elasticube licensing. Most damning: reports of 400% price increases at renewal and 85% "discounts" off inflated list prices.

## Detailed Pricing Analysis

### Base Pricing Ranges

**Small Deployments (5-15 users)**:
- Cloud: $21,000/year minimum (5 users)
- Self-hosted: $10,000/year minimum
- Per user claims: $49/user/month = misleading (minimums apply)

**Mid-Size (15-40 users)**:
- 35-40 users: ~$35,000/year (self-hosted)
- 15 power users + viewers: $60,000/year
- Cloud adds 40% premium over self-hosted

**Enterprise (40+ users)**:
- Average deal: $50,000-$137,000/year
- "Pro" tier: $109,000/year
- Large enterprises: Up to $167,000/year
- Multi-tenant: $10,000 PER ELASTICUBE (data model)

### Implementation Shock Costs

**Brutal Reality**:
> "Their Sisense implementation promised 'plug-and-play' embedding but delivered 14 weeks of dev time and $89,000 in first-year costs."

**Typical Implementation**:
- Small business: $5,000-$20,000
- Mid-size: $10,000-$50,000
- Enterprise: $50,000+
- Timeline: 14+ weeks (not "plug-and-play")

### Hidden Cost Bombshells

**Multi-Tenant Nightmare**:
> "At an average of $10,000 per Elasticube, that's a $200,000 annual cost just for data management before counting any other platform fees."

**Additional Fees**:
- Onboarding charges (mandatory)
- Team training costs
- Version upgrades
- Customer success team fees
- Professional services for customization

### Pricing Manipulation Tactics

**Fake Discounts**:
> "Sisense's initial prices felt so inflated that they were offered an 85% discount off the list price"

**Renewal Traps**:
> "One 2016 report mentioned a 400% price increase at renewal time – Sisense quadrupled the price when a customer's initial term ended."

**OEM Opacity**:
> "Sisense's pricing for OEM is highly negotiated and there is no real minimum or maximum price - just what you agree on with the sales team."

### True Total Cost of Ownership

**Year 1 Example (Mid-size)**:
- Software license: $60,000
- Implementation: $30,000
- Training: $10,000
- Total Year 1: $100,000+

**Ongoing Annual**:
- License renewal: $60,000 → $240,000 (after 400% increase)
- Support/success: $15,000+
- Additional Elasticubes: $10,000 each
- Upgrades/customization: Variable

### Competitive Cost Analysis

**Sisense vs Scoop Reality**:
- Sisense minimum: $21,000/year (5 users)
- Scoop: $3,588/year (unlimited workspace users)
- Sisense per additional user: $4,200/year
- Scoop per additional user: $0 (workspace model)

**200-User Comparison**:
- Sisense: ~$100,000-$150,000/year
- Scoop: $3,588/year
- Savings with Scoop: 96-98%

### Red Flags Summary
1. No published pricing = deliberate opacity
2. 85% "discounts" = fake inflated list prices
3. 400% renewal increases = bait and switch
4. $10K per data model = architectural cost trap
5. 14 weeks + $89K implementation = not self-service
6. Mandatory add-ons = true cost hidden

### Evidence Collected
- Real customer quotes and experiences
- Actual implementation timelines
- Hidden cost structures exposed
- Renewal price increase tactics
- Multi-tenant architectural penalties

### Cross-Reference Notes
- Pricing opacity matches ThoughtSpot pattern
- Implementation costs similar to Tellius
- Higher TCO than most Tier 3 competitors
- Confirms enterprise-only positioning
- Validates Tier 1 classification (expensive complexity)
