# Power BI Copilot Research Summary
**Date**: January 28, 2025
**Time**: 7:45 AM - 8:00 AM
**Focus**: END USER (Business User) Perspective - Not BI Analysts

## Critical Question: Can a Sales/Marketing/CS Person Actually Use This?

### Executive Reality Check
Power BI Copilot is fundamentally a tool FOR report builders and data analysts, not business users. It helps create DAX formulas, design report pages, and write measures - all technical BI tasks that business users don't do.

## Official Sources

### 1. Microsoft Learn Documentation
**URL**: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/copilot-introduction
**Key Finding**: Copilot is for "report authors" and "data model owners"

**What It Actually Does**:
- Helps write DAX queries (technical skill required)
- Suggests report page layouts (for report builders)
- Creates measure descriptions (for data modelers)
- Generates visualizations (within Power BI Desktop)

**Business User Reality**: 
- Requires Power BI Desktop (analyst tool)
- Needs understanding of measures, DAX, semantic models
- User must already be IN Power BI creating reports
- Not accessible from Slack, Teams, or email

### 2. Feature Updates (2025)
**Source**: Power BI Blog feature summaries
**Finding**: Even "standalone" Copilot requires Power BI access

**Standalone Copilot Claims vs Reality**:
- **Claim**: "Ask anything" about your data
- **Reality**: Must navigate to Power BI service first
- **Reality**: Searches for existing reports/models
- **Reality**: Still generates DAX formulas as answers
- **Reality**: Requires F2+ capacity ($2,500+/month)

## End User Experience Analysis

### What a Sales Person Would Experience:
1. **Can't Start**: No access from where they work (Slack/email)
2. **Navigation Hell**: Must log into Power BI portal
3. **Technical Answers**: Gets DAX formulas instead of insights
4. **Report Dependency**: Can only analyze existing reports
5. **No Discovery**: Just searches what analysts already built

### What They Actually Need (Scoop Provides):
1. **Start Where They Work**: Slack, not another portal
2. **Natural Conversation**: "Why are sales down?" not DAX
3. **Instant Answers**: Not "here's a formula to calculate it"
4. **Discovery**: Find insights they didn't know to ask for
5. **Zero Training**: Actually usable without BI knowledge

## Prerequisites & Complexity

### Technical Requirements for Copilot:
- F2 Fabric capacity or P1 Premium ($2,500-5,000/month minimum)
- Power BI licenses for all users
- Admin must enable in tenant settings
- Existing semantic models properly configured
- Reports already built by analysts
- Understanding of Power BI concepts

### Hidden Complexity:
- "Data must be prepared to work with Copilot"
- Needs proper semantic layer (IT project)
- Requires measure definitions
- Users need Power BI training
- 24-hour delay for new capacities

## Pricing Reality for Business Users

### Minimum Costs:
- **Fabric F2 Capacity**: $2,500/month base
- **Power BI Pro licenses**: $10/user/month
- **200 users**: $2,000/month licenses + $2,500 capacity = $4,500/month
- **Annual**: $54,000 minimum
- **Plus**: Implementation, training, report building

### Scoop Comparison:
- **Scoop**: $299/month total
- **Power BI + Copilot**: $4,500+/month
- **Savings**: 93% lower cost

## Real Limitations for Business Users

### From Community Forums:
1. **"Copilot and DAX query view option not available"** - Common issue
2. **Desktop versions don't support it** - Need constant updates
3. **Can't see measure definitions** - Sometimes hallucinates
4. **Sovereign cloud not supported** - Geographic limits
5. **English primarily** - Limited language support

### Fundamental Issues:
- **Not Self-Service**: Requires BI team to set up everything
- **No Mobile**: Tablet support added but limited
- **No Real AI**: Just translates questions to DAX
- **No ML Models**: No clustering, prediction, or discovery
- **Report Prison**: Can only work with pre-built reports

## The "AI" Reality

### What Power BI Copilot's "AI" Actually Does:
1. **Natural Language to DAX**: Translates questions to formulas
2. **Report Search**: Finds existing reports/models
3. **Visualization Suggestions**: Recommends chart types
4. **Summary Generation**: Describes what's in reports

### What It DOESN'T Do:
- ❌ Discover patterns
- ❌ Investigate root causes
- ❌ Predict outcomes
- ❌ Cluster or segment
- ❌ Multi-hypothesis testing
- ❌ Learn from interactions

## Business User Testimonial Reality

### What They'd Really Say:
> "I asked for sales insights and it gave me a DAX formula"

> "I still need IT to build the reports first"

> "It's just a search box for reports someone else made"

> "I went back to asking the data team"

## Competitive Intelligence

### Why Business Users Can't Actually Use Power BI Copilot:
1. **Wrong Starting Point**: Requires Power BI access
2. **Wrong Interface**: Desktop application or web portal
3. **Wrong Answers**: DAX formulas not insights
4. **Wrong Workflow**: Must interrupt work to use
5. **Wrong Skills**: Assumes BI knowledge

### Scoop's Business User Advantages:
1. **Starts in Slack**: Where they already work
2. **Natural Language**: Real conversations
3. **Actual Insights**: "Sales down due to X, Y, Z"
4. **ML Discovery**: Finds hidden patterns
5. **Zero Training**: Type question, get answer

## Evidence Needed:
- [ ] Screenshot of Copilot generating DAX (not insights)
- [ ] Screenshot of Power BI Desktop requirement
- [ ] Screenshot of capacity pricing
- [ ] Screenshot of technical prerequisites
- [ ] User complaints about complexity

## Key Takeaway:
Power BI Copilot is a BI analyst productivity tool marketed as end-user AI. It helps technical users write DAX formulas faster but offers nothing for actual business users who just want answers. A sales person would need weeks of Power BI training just to understand what Copilot is suggesting.
