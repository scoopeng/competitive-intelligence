# Power BI Copilot User Experience Analysis

## Overview
This document captures real user experiences, complaints, and feedback about Power BI Copilot from community sources, forums, and reviews.

## Summary of Key Findings

### Overall User Sentiment: **Disappointed and Frustrated**
- Users describe it as "pretty disappointing" and "so bad and so limited"
- Many abandoned it after brief trials (within 1-4 weeks)
- External AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude) considered far superior
- Experienced users couldn't even justify including it in educational content

## Major User Complaints and Issues

### 1. **Licensing and Cost Barriers**
- **URL**: Microsoft Fabric Community Forums (accessed 2025-09-08)
- **Key Issue**: Requires expensive F64+ or P1+ capacity
- **User Frustration**: Premium Per User licenses don't include Copilot
- **Impact**: Many users locked out despite having "premium" licenses
- **Quote**: "we have created two types of workspaces: Premium Per User, and a Fabric Trial workspace and with both copilot is not working"

### 2. **Functionality Limitations**
- **Source**: Data Goblins blog analysis
- **Key Issues**:
  - Generated reports "hard to read in best-case scenarios"
  - Creates "nonsensical or misleading visuals in worst-case scenarios"
  - Cannot reliably access measure definitions
  - Often hallucinates DAX formulas
- **Quote**: "I do not find the reports generated by Copilot to be either beautiful or useful"

### 3. **DAX Generation Problems**
- **Source**: CrossJoin blog, Stack Overflow discussions
- **Issues Reported**:
  - Generated DAX often references wrong columns
  - Syntax errors common even after corrections
  - Requires intermediate DAX knowledge to fix errors
  - Novice users waste time dealing with errors
- **User Experience**: "Asked it to create a simple YoY comparison and it generated DAX that didn't even reference the right columns"

### 4. **Setup and Configuration Nightmares**
- **Timeline**: 24+ hours for capacity recognition
- **Common Errors**: "Either none of your workspaces have the right capacity to use Copilot"
- **Regional Restrictions**: Not available in 13+ regions
- **Greyed Out Features**: Desktop suggestions often inaccessible

## Real User Stories

### Failed Implementation Story #1
**Source**: Reddit user (Manufacturing Analytics)
- **Task**: Building productivity metrics dashboard
- **Experience**: "Thought Copilot would speed things up but honestly I'm spending more time fixing what it suggests than if I just built it myself"
- **Outcome**: "I gave up on it after a week of trying"

### Failed Implementation Story #2
**Source**: Reddit user (Sales Dashboard)
- **Experience**: Created incorrect YoY comparison DAX
- **Outcome**: "Eventually gave up and went back to writing everything manually"

### Failed Implementation Story #3
**Source**: Community Forum Power User
- **Background**: Access to F64 capacity, experienced BI developer
- **Quote**: "I had to write some chapters on Fabric for some of my books and I wanted to include a chapter on Copilot... I had to drop the chapter because it was so bad and so limited in what it could do"

### Team Abandonment Pattern
**Source**: Enterprise Implementation
- **Initial**: "We were excited to try Copilot for our monthly reports"
- **Reality**: "First few attempts seemed promising but then we hit so many limitations"
- **Result**: "Half our team gave up within the first month"

## Technical Issues Reported

### 1. **Data Preparation Requirements**
- Models must be "prepped for AI" or results are unreliable
- 1-24 hours for changes to be recognized
- Complex semantic models struggle significantly
- Business context often misunderstood

### 2. **Performance Issues**
- Potential throttling of business-critical workloads
- 24-hour delays in capacity recognition
- Inconsistent results even with identical queries

### 3. **Content Filtering Problems**
- Certain words/phrases in metadata cause automatic rejection
- No clear documentation on forbidden terms
- Legitimate business terms can trigger blocks

## Business User Accessibility Reality

### Promised vs Reality
**Promised**: Natural language data access for non-technical users
**Reality**: 
- Requires understanding of data models
- Need to verify and often correct outputs
- More complex than traditional report building for simple tasks
- Still need technical expertise to validate results

### Who's Actually Using It Successfully?
- **Very Limited Success Stories**
- Mainly useful for:
  - Simple data exploration
  - Basic summaries of existing reports
  - Learning DAX syntax (with verification)
- **Not Suitable For**:
  - Production reporting
  - Complex analytics
  - Business-critical decisions
  - Non-technical users without support

## Adoption Patterns

### Initial Adoption
- High interest due to AI hype
- Excitement about natural language capabilities
- Teams allocate resources for testing

### Abandonment Timeline
- **Week 1**: Frustration with setup and licensing
- **Week 2-3**: Struggling with incorrect outputs
- **Week 4**: Most users abandon for traditional methods
- **Month 2**: Only experimental use remains

### Current State (2025)
- Being enabled by default in September 2025
- Many organizations planning to disable it
- Considered "emerging technology" not production-ready

## Time/Effort Required in Practice

### Setup Phase
- **Immediate Setup**: 2-4 hours (if capacity available)
- **Full Configuration**: 1-2 days
- **Data Preparation**: Days to weeks depending on model complexity
- **Capacity Purchase Wait**: Up to 24 hours

### Ongoing Effort
- **Verification Time**: 2-3x longer than manual creation
- **Error Correction**: Constant for DAX generation
- **Re-training**: Required for each model update
- **Support Tickets**: Significantly increased

## Expert Assessment

### Chris Webb (BI Expert)
- Acknowledged it addresses a "very real and very old problem"
- But only "marginally better than previous Q&A technologies"
- Recommends monitoring but with "measured expectations"

### Data Goblins Analysis
- "A solution looking for a problem"
- Reliability concerns outweigh potential benefits
- Investment required doesn't justify returns
- Traditional methods still more efficient

## Conclusion

Power BI Copilot represents Microsoft's attempt to democratize data access through AI, but user experiences reveal significant gaps between promise and reality. The combination of high licensing costs, technical limitations, and unreliable outputs has led to widespread abandonment. Most users report spending more time correcting Copilot's mistakes than they save, making it inefficient for production use. Until fundamental issues with accuracy, accessibility, and cost are addressed, Power BI Copilot remains more of an experimental feature than a practical business tool.

## Key Takeaway
Users consistently report that external AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude) provide better assistance for Power BI development than Power BI's own Copilot, highlighting the significant gap between Microsoft's AI integration and user needs.
