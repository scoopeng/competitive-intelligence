## Key Findings

### From Official Sources
1. **Not for Business Users**: Explicitly for "report authors"
2. **Hidden Costs**: Minimum $262/month capacity requirement
3. **Complex Setup**: 5-11 weeks implementation
4. **Data Prep Required**: 5-14 weeks of architect work
5. **Unreliable**: "Nondeterministic" with "misleading outputs"
6. **Geographic Limits**: Major markets excluded

### From Community Sources
1. **Consistent Failure**: Most abandon within 4-6 weeks
2. **DAX Issues**: Incorrect formulas, hallucinations
3. **Cost Shock**: $5,000+/month for proper capacity
4. **Alternative Solutions**: ChatGPT/Claude work better
5. **No Success Stories**: Notably absent
6. **Expert Rejection**: Even developers avoid it

## Critical Evidence Captured
- Microsoft's own warnings about reliability
- Real implementation timelines (weeks not minutes)
- Actual cost requirements ($5K+ not $20)
- User abandonment patterns
- Technical failure modes
- Business user accessibility barriers
