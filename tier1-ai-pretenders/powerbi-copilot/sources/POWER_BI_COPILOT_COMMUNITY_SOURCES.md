**Professional Services View**:

- Acknowledge significant setup requirements
- Emphasize need for data preparation
- Cautious optimism with many caveats

## Common Patterns Across Sources

### 1. **Licensing Frustration**
- Every source mentions capacity requirements
- Premium Per User confusion universal
- Cost barrier significant for testing

### 2. **Implementation Challenges**
- 24-hour delays common
- Regional restrictions problematic
- Configuration errors prevalent

### 3. **Quality Issues**
- DAX generation unreliable
- Visual suggestions poor
- Hallucination problems noted

### 4. **Abandonment Timeline**
- Week 1: Setup struggles
- Week 2-3: Quality issues emerge
- Week 4: Most give up
- Month 2: Minimal usage

### 5. **Expert Consensus**
- "Emerging technology" not production-ready
- External AI tools superior
- Requires significant expertise to use effectively
- More hindrance than help for most users

## Missing Perspectives

### Not Found in Research:
1. **Stack Overflow**: No specific Power BI Copilot questions/issues found
2. **G2/Capterra**: No dedicated Copilot reviews (only general Power BI)
3. **YouTube Comments**: Direct access to comments not available
4. **LinkedIn Posts**: Limited specific implementation stories

### Why These Gaps Matter:
- Suggests limited real-world usage
- May indicate users not getting far enough to ask technical questions
- Possible NDA or corporate policies limiting public discussion
- Could reflect rapid abandonment before community formation

## Verification Methods Used

1. **Cross-Referenced Claims**: Multiple sources confirm same issues
2. **Expert Validation**: Industry experts (Webb, Data Goblins) align with user complaints
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Consistent abandonment timeline across sources
4. **Technical Verification**: Licensing and setup issues confirmed in official docs

## Conclusion

The community consensus is clear: Power BI Copilot has failed to deliver on its promises. From licensing barriers to quality issues, users consistently report more frustration than value. The pattern of initial excitement followed by rapid abandonment is universal across different user types and use cases. Until Microsoft addresses fundamental issues with accessibility, reliability, and cost, Power BI Copilot will remain a cautionary tale in premature AI integration.
