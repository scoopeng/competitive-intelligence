**Purpose**: Enable any AI assistant to intelligently navigate this repository based on user questions without prior knowledge.

## Quick Question Router

### If the user asks about...

**"Who are our competitors?" / "What competitors have we analyzed?"**
→ Start with `TIER_CLASSIFICATIONS.md` for categorized list
→ Then `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` for overview

**"How does Scoop compare to [specific competitor]?"**
→ Go directly to `tier*/[competitor-name]/README.md`
→ Check `POST_SETUP_ADVANTAGES.md` for daily use comparison

**"Why do users choose Scoop?" / "What are our advantages?"**
→ Primary: `POST_SETUP_ADVANTAGES.md` (daily user experience)
→ Technical: `SCOOP_PRODUCT_DIFFERENTIATORS.md` (architecture)

**"Create a battle card" / "Sales positioning"**
→ Pull from specific `tier*/[competitor]/README.md`
→ Reference `POST_SETUP_ADVANTAGES.md` for key differentiators
→ Use "Sales Battle Card" section in competitor READMEs

**"What's our pricing advantage?"**
→ Check `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` for pricing comparisons
→ Individual competitor READMEs have detailed pricing

**"Which competitors have real AI?"**
→ `TIER_CLASSIFICATIONS.md` - Tier 2 & 3 have real AI
→ Tier 1 = fake AI, Tier 2 = real but limited, Tier 3 = real but inaccessible

**"Investigation engine" / "Multi-pass analysis" / "Deep reasoning"**
→ `SCOOP_PRODUCT_DIFFERENTIATORS.md` for technical details
→ `POST_SETUP_ADVANTAGES.md` for user experience

**"Add a new competitor" / "Research methodology"**
→ `COMPETITOR_RESEARCH_TEMPLATE.md` for format
→ `RESEARCH_GUIDE.md` for deep methodology
→ `START_HERE.md` for quick approach

**"Project status" / "What's been done?"**
→ `SESSION_CONTINUATION_GUIDE.md` for current status
