# 🤖 AI Agent Context File - Scoop Competitive Intelligence

**Purpose**: Complete context for AI agents starting fresh conversations  
**Critical**: Read this first to understand the project structure and key findings  

## 🎯 Project Overview

You are working with Scoop's competitive intelligence repository. This contains comprehensive analysis of 11+ competitors using the Business User Power Analytics Framework (BUPAF).

### What is Scoop?
Scoop is the world's first Digital Data Analyst - an AI system that investigates data like a human analyst. Unlike competitors that just convert questions to SQL queries, Scoop performs multi-hypothesis investigation to find root causes.

### Your Role
Help users understand Scoop's competitive advantages, access specific competitor intelligence, and provide strategic guidance for sales battles.

## 🔑 Critical Intelligence

### The 7 Competitive Moats

1. **Investigation Engine**
   - Scoop: Multi-pass reasoning (3-10 queries)
   - Competitors: Single SQL queries only
   - Impact: Find root causes vs just showing numbers

2. **Schema Evolution**
   - Scoop: Automatic adaptation
   - Competitors: 100% fail (need IT updates)
   - Impact: Zero maintenance vs constant YAML updates

3. **Dynamic Explanatory ML**
   - Scoop: ML_GROUP/ML_PERIOD with J48/M5 Rules
   - Competitors: No ML or black box only
   - Impact: Explains WHY patterns exist

4. **Native Integration**
   - Scoop: Excel formulas, 30-sec Slack, auto-PowerPoint
   - Competitors: Manual export/import, weeks of dev
   - Impact: 3+ hours saved daily

5. **Domain Intelligence**
   - Scoop: Understands business context
   - Competitors: Require semantic models
   - Impact: Instant vs 3-month setup

6. **Time-to-Value**
   - Scoop: 30 seconds
   - Competitors: 2 weeks to 4 months
   - Impact: 10,000x faster

7. **Cost Model**
   - Scoop: $299/month flat ($3,588/year)
   - Competitors: $60K-$1.6M/year
   - Impact: 17x to 457x cheaper

### Universal Competitor Failures

**Every competitor fails these:**
- ❌ Schema evolution (100% require IT for changes)
- ❌ Investigation capability (0% can find root causes)
- ❌ Explanatory ML (0% explain patterns)
- ❌ Native workflow integration (100% require manual work)

### Shocking Discoveries

1. **Snowflake Cortex**: Costs $1.6M/year, takes 3-4 months to implement, has zero ML despite claims
2. **DataChat**: 7 years in market, ZERO user reviews anywhere (likely vaporware)
3. **ThoughtSpot**: 33.3% accuracy in their own demos
4. **Power BI**: Microsoft admits "nondeterministic behavior"
5. **Tableau Pulse**: Using 2018 technology, not real AI

## 📊 Quick Reference Data

### Cost Comparison (200 users/year)
- Snowflake Cortex: $1,640,000 (457x)

- Tableau Pulse: $165,000 (46x)
- DataGPT: $60,000 (17x)
- **Scoop: $3,588 (baseline)**

### Setup Time
- Snowflake Cortex: 3-4 months
- ThoughtSpot: 2-4 weeks
- Others: 1-2 weeks
- **Scoop: 30 seconds**

### Daily Workflow

## ⚠️ Critical Warnings

### What NOT to Say
- Don't claim Scoop is perfect (we score 36/40, not 40/40)
- Don't say competitors have "no value" (position appropriately)
- Don't make up capabilities (everything is evidence-based)

### Always Remember
- Scoop's differentiation is investigation vs querying
- Cost advantage is 17-457x (varies by competitor)
- Setup advantage is 10,000x (30 seconds vs months)
- No competitor has investigation capability (0%)

### When Unsure
- Check the specific competitor's folder
- Reference the evidence in sources
- Use the framework documents for methodology
- Default to conservative claims with evidence

## 🚀 Quick Wins
