# Research Best Practices - Learned from Power BI Copilot Implementation

## Key Learnings

### 1. Research Library Organization
**Problem**: Phase 2 research (24 searches) generated extensive documentation that overwhelmed the main checklist file.

**Solution**: Always separate research into dedicated phase files:
- `evidence/phase1_research_library.md`
- `evidence/phase2_research_library.md`
- `evidence/phase3_research_library.md`

**Benefits**:
- Keeps main checklist clean and readable
- Allows for comprehensive documentation without clutter
- Maintains searchability and organization
- Provides clear file references for sales teams

### 2. Summary Structure in Main Checklist
**Format**: Each phase should have 5-8 key findings summarized in main checklist:
- Customer stories: [Top 2-3 implementation failures/complaints]
- Industry verticals: [Top 2-3 industry-specific issues]
- Performance: [Top 2-3 performance/scalability issues]
- Competition: [Top 2-3 competitive weaknesses]
- Economics: [Top 2-3 cost/ROI concerns]

### 3. Documentation Process
**Always document as you go**:
1. Create phase research library file when starting each phase
2. Add each URL/search result immediately after visiting
3. Use comprehensive evidence format (not brief summaries)
4. Update main checklist summary after completing each phase

### 4. Scalability Principles
**Simple and consistent approach**:
- No conditional logic (thresholds, complexity decisions)
- Same structure for all competitors
- Clear file naming conventions
- Predictable organization pattern

## Template Updates Applied

### Critical Instructions Enhanced
- Added Section 4: Research Library Organization
- Updated Section 2: Document as you go (references phase files)
- Maintains all existing edge case handling

### Research Library Sections Standardized
- All phases now reference separate evidence files
- Consistent summary format across all competitors
- Clear file path references for quick access

## Files Updated
- `COMPETITOR_RESEARCH_TEMPLATE.md` - Master template with new approach
- All 11 competitor `RESEARCH_CHECKLIST.md` files updated consistently
- `competitors/power-bi-copilot/evidence/phase2_research_library.md` - Example implementation

## Impact
- **Scalability**: Same approach works for any competitor research volume
- **Clarity**: Main checklists stay clean and actionable
- **Completeness**: No research is lost or abbreviated
- **Usability**: Sales teams get both summaries and detailed evidence
- **Consistency**: All competitors follow identical organization pattern

## Next Steps
Future competitor research will automatically follow this improved structure, ensuring consistent quality and organization regardless of research volume.
