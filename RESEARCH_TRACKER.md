## Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Tableau Pulse (Today)
1. Execute all 3 chunks with full rigor
2. Verify outputs meet quality standards
3. Update battle card with findings

### Phase 2: Power BI Copilot
1. Re-run with improved chunks
2. Focus on customer evidence gaps

### Phase 3: Create chunks for remaining 9
1. Use CHUNK_TEMPLATE.md
2. Customize for each competitor
3. Execute systematically

## Quality Standards
- 10+ customer complaints with context
- 5+ implementation horror stories
- 15+ direct quotes with sources
- Quantified performance metrics
- True TCO with hidden costs
- BUPAF scoring with evidence
