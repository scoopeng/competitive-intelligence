# Domain Intelligence Migration Report
**Date**: November 19, 2025
**Status**: Complete

## 1. Executive Summary
This report documents the comprehensive update of the Competitive Intelligence repository to align with Scoop's new strategic positioning: **"The Domain Intelligence Platform."**

The previous narrative focused on "AI Analyst" and "Generative BI." The new strategy emphasizes **architectural differentiation**, specifically contrasting Scoop's **Encoded Expertise** and **Autonomous Investigation** against competitors' reliance on generic LLMs ("Hallucination Engines"), passive dashboards, and single-query search bars.

## 2. Core Narrative & Architectural Shifts
We have introduced a standardized "Scoop Stack" vocabulary across all competitive assets to define our category:

*   **Category**: From "AI Analyst" → **"Domain Intelligence Platform"**
*   **Core Engine**: From "Multi-pass SQL" → **"Investigation Coordinator"** (State Machine)
*   **Knowledge Layer**: From "Business Logic" → **"Encoded Expertise (Schema v2.8)"**
*   **Integration**: From "Excel Support" → **"Spreadsheet Calculation Engine"** & **"True Workflow Integration"**
*   **Reliability**: From "Accuracy" → **"Deterministic Domain Intelligence"** & **"Cloud-Native Reliability"**

## 3. Asset Update Summary

### A. Core Strategy Frameworks
| File | Status | Key Updates |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md` | **Updated** | Added "Domain Intelligence" & "Encoded Expertise" dimensions. Scored all competitors against these new standards. |
| `QUICK_START.md` | **Updated** | Refined "How to Win" guides to prioritize architectural arguments (Context Gap, Workflow Destruction). |
| `COMPETITIVE_SUMMARY.md` | **Updated** | Redefined market map into 3 categories: Passive BI, Generic AI, Domain Intelligence. Grouped competitors by fatal architectural flaws. |

### B. Competitor Battle Cards (Complete Overhaul)
All 11 primary competitor files were reframed to highlight specific architectural weaknesses using the new Domain Intelligence vocabulary.

| Competitor | Primary Weakness Reframe |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Power BI Copilot** | **The Context Gap**: Generic LLM vs. Encoded Expertise. |
| **Snowflake Cortex** | **The Hallucination Engine**: Probability vs. Deterministic Intelligence. |
| **Tableau Pulse** | **The "So What?" Gap**: Metric monitoring vs. Root Cause Analysis. |
| **ThoughtSpot** | **The Intelligence Ceiling**: Search bar limits vs. Autonomous Investigation. |
| **Qlik** | **The Legacy Anchor**: On-prem complexity vs. Cloud-Native Agility. |
| **Domo** | **The Data Trap**: Proprietary storage vs. Direct Data Warehouse Querying. |
| **Zenlytic** | **The Semantic Void**: Partial semantic layer vs. Full Encoded Expertise. |
| **Sisense** | **Architectural Mismatch**: Embedded ISV focus vs. Business User Autonomy. |
| **DataGPT** | **Data Silos**: Single-source limitations vs. Multi-source Domain Intelligence. |
| **Tellius** | **Architectural Instability**: Apache Spark crashes vs. Cloud-Native Reliability. |
| **DataChat** | **Workflow Destruction**: Zero Excel/API support vs. True Workflow Integration. |

## 4. Key Differentiators Defined (The "Kill Shots")

1.  **Against Generic AI (Cortex, Copilot)**: Attack the **Context Gap**. They guess; we know.
2.  **Against Passive BI (Tableau, Power BI)**: Attack the **Manual Labor**. They require "mining"; we provide "answers."
3.  **Against Search & SQL Tools (ThoughtSpot, Zenlytic, DataGPT)**: Attack the **Intelligence Ceiling**. They translate text-to-SQL; we investigate root causes.
4.  **Against Walled Gardens (Tellius, DataChat)**: Attack **Workflow Destruction**. They force tool abandonment; we enhance Excel and Slack.

## 5. Next Steps
*   **Sales Enablement**: Distribute the new `COMPETITIVE_SUMMARY.md` to the sales team.
*   **Content Generation**: Use the updated Battle Cards to generate fresh "vs. Competitor" web pages.
*   **Training**: Brief the team on the "Scoop Stack" vocabulary (Investigation Coordinator, Encoded Expertise).

**Repository State**: All targeted files (`competitive-intelligence/`) are fully aligned with the Q4 2025 Domain Intelligence strategy.
