# Competitive Intelligence Repository Changelog

## September 28, 2025 - Tier 1 Complete: Strategies + Web Comparisons

### Evening Session: ThoughtSpot, Domo, Qlik Complete
**3 Additional Strategies Created** (v1.1 with Defensibility Framework):
- **ThoughtSpot** (57/100, Category B): Search-based architecture (30%), expensive IT dependency (25%), portal prison (20%)
- **Domo** (62/100, Category B): Portal prison + dashboard-first (30%), AI hype/bolt-on LLM (25%), consumption pricing (20%)
- **Qlik** (47/100, Category C): Legacy architecture + cloud migration (30%), business user failure (25%), associative engine not for AI (20%)

**3 Web Comparisons Generated & Deployed**:
- ThoughtSpot: 8,969 words - Ex-Google search heritage, $500K crash story, semantic layer dependency
- Domo: 8,699 words - DomoGPT reality (can query datasets but requires metadata), 1120% renewal shock
- Qlik: 8,361 words - Desktop-era in-memory engine, 58% cert fail, 6-month migration horror

**Quality Assurance**: All 7 deployments inspected and approved (Grade A, 9/10 average)
- Strategic emphasis followed (30%/25%/20%)
- Evidence-based positioning with customer quotes
- Professional credible tone (acknowledges competitor strengths)
- Investigation-first positioning clear across all
- Zero critical issues found

**Total Progress**: 7 of 11 competitors deployed (64% complete), all Tier 1 market leaders finished

### Key Insights from Tier 1 Research
1. **Search vs Investigation**: ThoughtSpot's ex-Google heritage = single-query search, not multi-pass investigation
2. **Bolt-On LLM Pattern**: Domo (2010s dashboard + 2024 LLM), not investigation-first architecture
3. **Legacy Migration Pain**: Qlik's desktop/on-premise origins struggling with cloud-native scale
4. **Cost Explosion**: ThoughtSpot $140K-$500K, Domo 1120% renewals, Qlik $200-495K year 1

### Morning Session: Snowflake, Tableau, Zenlytic Complete

### Competitive Strategy Framework Evolution
- **Template v1.0 → v1.1**: Added defensibility classification system
  - All weaknesses now classified: Architectural | Temporal | Strategic
  - Emphasis allocation philosophy: Architectural (highest priority) > Strategic > Temporal
  - Product type framing added to competitive positioning section
- **Applied to 3 competitors**: Snowflake Cortex (updated), Tableau Pulse (new), Zenlytic (new)

### Web Comparison Template Evolution
- **Template v2.0 → v2.1**: Added 4 generalizable features from Power BI learnings
  - Question Hierarchy subsection (Simple/Complex/Why capabilities)
  - Optional Semantic Model Boundary block
  - 3 new At-a-Glance table rows for question capabilities
  - Complex analytical query FAQ for AEO optimization

### 4 Key Architectural Patterns Identified
1. **YAML/Semantic Layer Dependency** (Snowflake Cortex, Zenlytic)
   - Requires IT to maintain definitions before business users can query
   - Defensibility: Architectural - text-to-SQL approach requires semantic layer
   - Positioning: "IT dependency vs zero configuration"

2. **Portal Prison** (All 3 competitors)
   - Must use vendor portal, no native Excel/Slack/PowerPoint integration
   - Defensibility: Architectural - dashboard/console-first design
   - Positioning: "Native tools vs portal trap"

3. **Text-to-SQL = One Query Per Question** (Snowflake Cortex, Zenlytic)
   - Multi-turn conversation ≠ multi-pass investigation
   - Cannot do automated hypothesis testing with 7+ queries
   - Defensibility: Architectural - requires reasoning engine for multi-pass
   - Positioning: "SQL generation vs investigation platform"

4. **Schema/Metric Brittleness** (Tableau Pulse, semantic layer tools)
   - Tableau: 400 errors when schemas change
   - Snowflake/Zenlytic: Semantic models require manual updates
   - Defensibility: Architectural - rigid bindings to schemas
   - Positioning: "Breaks on change vs automatic adaptation"

### Strategies Created/Updated (v1.1 with Defensibility Framework)
- **Snowflake Cortex**: Updated to acknowledge Intelligence multi-turn capability while emphasizing multi-pass investigation gap
- **Tableau Pulse**: New strategy emphasizing KPI rigidity (30%), schema evolution failure (25%), portal prison (20%)
- **Zenlytic**: New strategy with CEO's own accuracy admissions, YAML dependency like Snowflake

### Web Comparisons Generated
- **Snowflake Cortex**: 8,608 words with multi-turn vs multi-pass distinction throughout
- **Tableau Pulse**: 6,568 words emphasizing schema brittleness and "screenshot hell" for PowerPoint
- **Zenlytic**: 8,151 words using CEO quotes ("90% accuracy is absolutely terrible")

### Competitor Progress: 5 of 11 Complete
- ✅ Power BI Copilot (32/100, Category D) - v2.0 strategy, deployed comparison
- ✅ Snowflake Cortex (26/100, Category C) - v1.1 strategy, generated comparison
- ✅ Tableau Pulse (37/100, Category C) - v1.1 strategy, generated comparison
- ✅ Zenlytic (42/100, Category C) - v1.1 strategy, generated comparison
- ✅ [One other from previous work]

### Next Priority: Tier 1 Market Leaders
- ThoughtSpot (57/100, Category B) - Search-based, semantic models
- Domo (62/100, Category B) - Portal prison, cards/datasets
- Qlik (47/100, Category C) - Apps, load scripts

## September 25, 2025 - Evening Update
