# Battle Card: Zenlytic

**BUPAF Score**: 18/50 (Category D - Marketing Mirage)  
**Market Position**: SQL-first for technical users  
**Key Weakness**: YAML configuration nightmare

---

## Quick Win Discovery Questions
1. "Who maintains your Zenlytic YAML files?"
2. "How long to add a new metric or dimension?"
3. "What percentage of business users can write YAML?"

## Killer Facts
- **YAML/SQL required** - Technical users only
- **Git workflow** - Pull requests for metrics
- **No investigation** - Single SQL queries
- **No ML capabilities** - Despite AI claims
- **Weeks to configure** - Complex semantic layer
- **Zero business user independence** - IT dependent

## Head-to-Head

| Factor | Zenlytic | Scoop | Your Win |
|--------|----------|-------|----------|
| User Requirement | YAML/SQL/Git | Natural language | "Technical barrier" |
| Configuration | Weeks of YAML | 30 seconds | "Months vs minutes" |
| Investigation | ❌ SQL only | ✅ Multi-hypothesis | "Can't find causes" |
| Business Users | ❌ Excluded | ✅ Empowered | "IT bottleneck" |
| Schema Changes | YAML updates | Automatic | "More YAML hell" |
| True Cost | $50K+ (+ IT time) | $3,588 | "Hidden IT costs" |

## Workflow Integration Gap

**Zenlytic Reality**: Terminal and Git for analytics
- No Excel integration - not even exports
- No PowerPoint capability - not their focus
- No Slack integration - technical portal only

**Scoop Advantage**: Business tools for business users
- =SCOOP() formulas business users understand
- PowerPoint your executives expect
- Slack where teams collaborate

**Time Impact**: Weeks of YAML configuration before first insight

## Objection Handlers

**"Zenlytic has version control"**  
"Great for developers, terrible for business users. Your marketing manager isn't going to write YAML and submit pull requests for campaign analysis."

**"It's powerful once configured"**  
"After weeks of YAML writing. And every change needs more YAML. Scoop works in 30 seconds and adapts automatically."

**"We have technical users"**  
"Then they're doing configuration instead of analysis. Zenlytic turns analysts into YAML maintainers."

## The Winning Pitch
"Zenlytic requires YAML configuration, SQL knowledge, and Git workflows - it's built for engineers, not business users. Your business teams will never achieve independence; they'll always need IT to write YAML for new metrics. After weeks of configuration, you get single SQL queries that can't investigate problems. Scoop empowers actual business users in 30 seconds with natural language, automatic schema evolution, and investigation capabilities - no YAML, no SQL, no Git required."

## Proof Points
- Show their YAML documentation (intimidating)
- Ask who will maintain semantic models
- Calculate IT hours for YAML maintenance
- Demo business user independence

## Technical Reality
```yaml
# Zenlytic metric definition example
- name: revenue
  type: measure
  sql: SUM(order_total)
  filters:
    - status != 'cancelled'
  description: "Total revenue from completed orders"
  format: currency
```
**vs Scoop**: "Show me revenue trends"

## Red Flags
- Documentation assumes technical expertise
- "Zoë" AI is just SQL generation
- No actual ML algorithms
- Requires data warehouse
- Business users need constant IT support
