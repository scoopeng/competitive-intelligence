**BUPAF Score**: 12/50 (Category D - Marketing Mirage)  
**Market Position**: Legacy BI with fake AI  
**Key Weakness**: ARIMA from 1970s, not real AI

---

## Quick Win Discovery Questions
1. "How long was your Sisense implementation?"
2. "What happened to Simply Ask feature?"
3. "Can Sisense investigate why metrics changed?"

## Killer Facts
- **14+ week implementation** typical
- **ARIMA isn't AI** - Statistical method from 1970s
- **Simply Ask deprecated** - Their "AI" failed
- **400% renewal increases** documented
- **Embedded analytics focus** - Not self-service
- **$200K+ total cost** with implementation

## Head-to-Head

| Factor | Sisense | Scoop | Your Win |
|--------|---------|-------|----------|
| AI Technology | ARIMA (1970s) | Modern LLM + ML | "Not actual AI" |
| Implementation | 14+ weeks | 30 seconds | "Months of consulting" |
| Schema Evolution | ❌ Manual updates | ✅ Automatic | "Breaks on changes" |
| Investigation | ❌ None | ✅ Multi-hypothesis | "Dashboard narration" |
| Renewal Increases | 400% documented | Flat pricing | "Budget shock" |
| Annual Cost | $200K+ | $3,588 | "56x more expensive" |

## Workflow Integration Gap

**Sisense Reality**: Embedded analytics platform
- No Excel integration - built for embedding
- No PowerPoint capability - not their market
- No Slack integration - dashboard only

**Scoop Advantage**: Direct business user tools
- Native Excel formulas for analysts
- PowerPoint for executives
- Slack for collaboration

**Time Impact**: 14+ weeks implementation, then 3+ hours per report

## Objection Handlers

**"Sisense has AI capabilities"**  
"They use ARIMA from the 1970s and call it AI. They deprecated their 'Simply Ask' feature because it didn't work. That's not AI, it's marketing."

**"It's a mature platform"**  
"Mature means legacy. They're focused on embedded analytics for software vendors, not business user empowerment. Different market entirely."

**"We need embedded analytics"**  
"Then you're building software, not empowering business users. Sisense is for ISVs, Scoop is for business teams."

## The Winning Pitch
"Sisense markets ARIMA time-series forecasting from the 1970s as 'AI' while deprecating their actual AI attempt (Simply Ask) because it failed. After 14+ weeks of implementation costing $200K+, you get a platform designed for embedding in software products, not empowering business users. They're known for 400% renewal increases and focus on ISVs, not enterprises. Scoop provides real AI investigation capabilities in 30 seconds for $3,588/year - actual AI for actual business users."

## Proof Points
- Show ARIMA isn't AI (Wikipedia from 1970s)
- Ask about Simply Ask deprecation
- Document renewal increase stories
- Calculate 56x cost difference

## Red Flags
- "Compose SDK" - They're pivoting to developers
- Fusion focus means abandoning self-service
- Multiple failed AI attempts
- Customer complaints about pricing
- 14+ weeks typical implementation
