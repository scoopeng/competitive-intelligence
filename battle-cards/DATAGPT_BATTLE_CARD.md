# Battle Card: DataGPT

**BUPAF Score**: 18/50 (Category D - Marketing Mirage)  
**Market Position**: Fast metrics, rigid schema  
**Key Weakness**: No schema evolution after setup

---

## Quick Win Discovery Questions
1. "What happens when you add a new data column?"
2. "Can DataGPT investigate why metrics changed?"
3. "How do you get insights into Excel or PowerPoint?"

## Killer Facts
- **Schema rigid after setup** - "Rare to adjust" per their docs
- **No investigation** - Single metrics only
- **No Excel integration** - Portal-only access
- **85% adoption claim** - But tiny customer base
- **$60,000+/year** - For single-source queries
- **Can't handle unstructured data** - Structured only

## Head-to-Head

| Factor | DataGPT | Scoop | Your Win |
|--------|---------|-------|----------|
| Schema Evolution | ❌ Rigid | ✅ Automatic | "Set in stone after setup" |
| Investigation | ❌ Single metrics | ✅ Multi-hypothesis | "What, not why" |
| Data Sources | ❌ Single source | ✅ Multiple | "One database only" |
| Excel Integration | ❌ None | ✅ =SCOOP() formulas | "Trapped in portal" |
| Annual Cost | $60,000+ | $3,588 | "17x more expensive" |
| Setup Time | 2-4 weeks | 30 seconds | "Weeks vs instant" |

## Workflow Integration Gap

**DataGPT Reality**: Another portal to check
- No Excel formulas - manual exports only
- No PowerPoint integration - copy/paste screenshots
- No Slack capability - separate login required

**Scoop Advantage**: Analytics in YOUR tools
- Native =SCOOP() formulas with refresh
- Board-ready PowerPoint in 30 seconds
- Complete analysis without leaving Slack

**Time Impact**: 3+ hours manual work per report for DataGPT users

## Objection Handlers

**"DataGPT is fast"**  
"Fast at showing single metrics, but can't investigate why they changed. Speed without depth isn't valuable. Scoop is fast AND investigates root causes."

**"They claim 85% adoption"**  
"Among their tiny customer base. Ask for references - they have very few actual users. Our adoption is proven across thousands."

**"It's simple to use"**  
"Until you need to add a column or investigate a problem. Their schema is rigid after setup, and they can't do multi-hypothesis testing."

## The Winning Pitch
"DataGPT provides fast metrics but with a rigid schema that rarely gets adjusted after setup. When your business changes - adding products, metrics, or data sources - you're stuck. They can show you WHAT happened but never WHY, and at $60,000/year, you're paying 17x more than Scoop for single-source queries trapped in their portal. Scoop adapts automatically, investigates root causes, and delivers insights in Excel, PowerPoint, and Slack for $3,588/year."

## Proof Points
- Ask about schema changes (they admit it's rare)
- Demo investigation vs single metrics
- Show multi-source analysis they can't do
- Calculate 17x cost difference

## Competitive Intelligence
- Very small customer base despite years in market
- "Lightning Cache" is just caching, not intelligence
- No semantic layer capabilities
- Requires significant data preparation
- Limited to structured data only
