# Battle Card: Power BI Copilot

**BUPAF Score**: 17/50 (Category D - Marketing Mirage)  
**Parent**: Microsoft  
**Key Weakness**: Nondeterministic behavior, Excel COPILOT separate

---

## Quick Win Discovery Questions
1. "Is Excel COPILOT included with Power BI Copilot?"
2. "What does Microsoft mean by 'nondeterministic behavior'?"
3. "Can it investigate across data sources?"

## Killer Facts
- **Microsoft admits**: "Can produce misleading outputs"
- **Nondeterministic**: Same question, different answers
- **Hidden costs**: $262+ minimum, PPU licenses excluded
- **Excel confusion**: COPILOT function is separate product/license
- **No investigation**: Generate reports, not find causes

## Head-to-Head

| Factor | Power BI Copilot | Scoop | Your Win |
|--------|------------------|-------|----------|
| Reliability | ❌ Nondeterministic | ✅ Consistent | "Microsoft admits misleading outputs" |
| Excel Integration | ❌ Separate license | ✅ Native =SCOOP() | "Different products, different costs" |
| Investigation | ❌ Report generation | ✅ Multi-hypothesis | "Generates text, not insights" |
| True Cost | $262+/user/month | $299/month flat | "Hidden PPU costs" |
| Schema Handling | ❌ Manual updates | ✅ Automatic | "Breaks on changes" |
| Native Tools | ❌ Portal + exports | ✅ Excel/PPT/Slack | "Leave workflow constantly" |

## Objection Handlers

**"Microsoft integration is seamless"**  
"Actually, Excel COPILOT and Power BI Copilot are separate products with separate licenses. You need both, and they don't work together. That's fragmentation, not integration."

**"It's backed by OpenAI"**  
"Which Microsoft admits causes 'nondeterministic behavior' and 'misleading outputs.' Same question, different answers. That's not analytics - it's gambling."

**"We're already in Microsoft ecosystem"**  
"Which means you're paying for Teams, Office, Power BI, and now separate Copilots for each. We integrate with your Excel natively - one tool, one price."

## The Winning Pitch
"Microsoft's own documentation warns that Power BI Copilot has 'nondeterministic behavior' and can 'produce misleading outputs.' That means asking the same question twice gives different answers. Plus, the Excel COPILOT you want is a completely separate product with another license. You'll pay $262+ per user monthly for unreliable report generation. Scoop gives consistent investigation results, native Excel integration, and costs 50x less for your entire organization."

## Proof Points
- Show Microsoft's warning documentation
- Demonstrate consistent vs random results  
- Calculate true cost with all licenses
- Show =SCOOP() vs =COPILOT() differences

## Verify This Yourself

### Nondeterministic Behavior
1. Visit: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/fundamentals/copilot-power-bi-privacy-security
2. Search for "nondeterministic"
3. Read Microsoft's own warning about different outputs from same prompts

### Excel Separate License
1. Visit: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/copilotpro
2. Note: "each will need to buy their own Copilot Pro subscription"
3. Check: Excel features are preview-only and English-only

### Capacity Requirements
1. Visit: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/copilot-introduction
2. Find: "F2 or higher" or "P1 or higher" requirement
3. Calculate: F64 minimum = $60,000+/year

### Output Quality Issues
1. Visit: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/copilot-prepare-data-ai
2. Find: "generic, inaccurate, or even misleading outputs"
3. Note: Microsoft's own admission of quality problems
