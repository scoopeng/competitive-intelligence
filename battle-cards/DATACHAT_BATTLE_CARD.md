## Quick Win Discovery Questions
1. "Can you show me DataChat user reviews on any platform?"
2. "Do you have references we can speak with?"
3. "What's the actual user adoption rate?"

## Killer Facts
- **ZERO reviews** on G2, Capterra, TrustRadius after 7 years
- **No user community** or forum exists
- **No case studies** with named customers
- **Opaque pricing** - complete black box
- **"AutoML"** is just templates, not real ML

## Head-to-Head

| Factor | DataChat | Scoop | Your Win |
|--------|----------|-------|----------|
| Market Evidence | ❌ Zero reviews | ✅ Many testimonials | "7 years, not one review" |
| Real ML | ❌ Templates only | ✅ ML native | "AutoML is just templates" |
| Customer Success | ❌ None visible | ✅ Case studies | "No verifiable customers" |
| Pricing | ❌ Hidden | ✅ $299/month | "Won't tell you price" |
| Investigation | ❌ SQL queries | ✅ Multi-hypothesis | "Chat interface to SQL" |

## Objection Handlers

**"They have AI/ML capabilities"**  
"Their 'AutoML' is pre-built templates, not machine learning. After 7 years, there's not a single user review anywhere. If it worked, someone would have said something."

**"Founded by a CS professor"**  
"Academic credentials don't equal business value. 7 years without a single user testimonial suggests the product doesn't deliver."

**"They claim Fortune 500 customers"**  
"But can't name a single one. No case studies, no testimonials, no reviews. That's not customer success - that's marketing fiction."

## The Winning Pitch
"DataChat has been in market for 7 years without a single user review on any platform - not G2, not Capterra, nothing. No user community, no case studies, no testimonials. Their 'AutoML' is just templates, and they won't publish pricing. This looks more like vaporware than a real product. Scoop has proven customers, transparent pricing at $299/month, and actual ML capabilities with our investigation engine. We have the reviews and references to prove it works."

## Proof Points
- Search for reviews together (find none)
- Ask for three references (they can't)
- Request AutoML demo (see templates)
- Show Scoop testimonials (we have many)

## Red Flags
- No Gartner/Forrester coverage
- No conference presentations
- No user community
- No transparent pricing
- No technical documentation
- Dependent on OpenAI for NLP
