# Battle Card: Tellius

**BUPAF Score**: 20/50 (Category C - Analyst Workbench)  
**Market Position**: Real ML but enterprise complexity  
**Key Weakness**: Too complex for business users

---

## Quick Win Discovery Questions
1. "How many data scientists do you have for Tellius?"
2. "What's the total cost including implementation?"
3. "What percentage of business users actively use it?"

## Killer Facts
- **$100,000+/year** typical enterprise cost
- **Requires data team** - Not self-service
- **12+ week implementation** - Complex setup
- **ML is black box** - Can't explain predictions
- **No Excel integration** - Dashboard only
- **Enterprise complexity** - Steep learning curve

## Head-to-Head

| Factor | Tellius | Scoop | Your Win |
|--------|---------|-------|----------|
| Business Users | ❌ Need training | ✅ Instant use | "Months to productivity" |
| Implementation | 12+ weeks | 30 seconds | "Quarter vs instant" |
| ML Explainability | ❌ Black box | ✅ Explained | "Trust requires transparency" |
| Annual Cost | $100,000+ | $3,588 | "28x more expensive" |
| Excel Integration | ❌ None | ✅ Native formulas | "Dashboard prison" |
| Maintenance | Data team required | Self-service | "Hidden FTE costs" |

## Workflow Integration Gap

**Tellius Reality**: Another complex platform to master
- No Excel formulas - dashboard exports only
- No PowerPoint integration - manual screenshots
- No Slack capability - separate platform entirely

**Scoop Advantage**: Simple tools, powerful analysis
- =SCOOP() formulas anyone can use
- PowerPoint ready for the boardroom
- Full analysis in Slack conversation

**Time Impact**: 3-6 months before business users are productive

## Objection Handlers

**"Tellius has real AI/ML"**  
"True, but it's black box ML that business users can't understand or trust. Scoop's ML explains WHY patterns exist, building confidence in decisions."

**"It's powerful once implemented"**  
"After 12+ weeks and $100,000+. And you still need data scientists to use it effectively. That's not democratization."

**"We need advanced analytics"**  
"Tellius provides advanced analytics for data scientists. Scoop provides powerful analytics for business users. Which drives more value?"

## The Winning Pitch
"Tellius has genuine ML capabilities, but they're trapped in enterprise complexity that excludes business users. At $100,000+ annually plus implementation costs, you're paying for a platform that requires data scientists to operate and months to implement. The ML is black box - you get predictions without explanations. Scoop delivers explainable ML that business users can actually use, in tools they know, for $3,588/year with 30-second setup."

## Proof Points
- Calculate total cost with implementation
- Ask about data team requirements
- Show explainable ML vs black box
- Demo business user independence

## Competitive Intelligence
- Genuine ML but poor accessibility
- "Genius" feature still requires expertise
- Heavy services component to revenue
- Limited customer base despite capabilities
- Struggles with business user adoption
