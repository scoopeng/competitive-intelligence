# Battle Card: Qlik Insight Advisor

**BUPAF Score**: 11/50 (Category D - Marketing Mirage)  
**Market Position**: Failed AI attempt on legacy BI  
**Key Weakness**: Can't handle typos, zero adoption

---

## Quick Win Discovery Questions
1. "What happens when users make typos in Qlik?"
2. "What percentage actively use Insight Advisor?"
3. "Should users type 'customer' or 'customers'?"

## Killer Facts
- **Can't handle typos** - Exact match only
- **Plurals break it** - "Customer" vs "Customers"
- **Zero adoption** - Consultants report no usage
- **Not real AI** - Rule-based pattern matching
- **5+ years, no improvement** - Abandoned feature
- **$340K+ annual cost** typical enterprise

## Head-to-Head

| Factor | Qlik Insight | Scoop | Your Win |
|--------|--------------|-------|----------|
| Typo Handling | ❌ Fails completely | ✅ Understands intent | "One typo breaks it" |
| Language Understanding | ❌ Exact match | ✅ Natural language | "Plurals confuse it" |
| Adoption Rate | ~0% reported | 85%+ | "No one uses it" |
| AI Technology | Rules from 2000s | Modern LLM + ML | "Not actually AI" |
| Investigation | ❌ None | ✅ Multi-hypothesis | "Can't find causes" |
| Annual Cost | $340K+ | $3,588 | "95x more expensive" |

## Workflow Integration Gap

**Qlik Reality**: Complex platform nobody masters
- No Excel integration - Qlik formulas only
- No PowerPoint capability - export screenshots
- No Slack integration - another portal

**Scoop Advantage**: Tools people actually use
- Excel formulas everyone knows
- PowerPoint executives expect
- Slack where work happens

**Time Impact**: Months of training, then abandoned

## Objection Handlers

**"Qlik is a Gartner leader"**  
"For traditional BI, not AI. Insight Advisor has near-zero adoption after 5+ years. Even Gartner doesn't highlight their AI."

**"It's integrated with our Qlik deployment"**  
"But no one uses it. Ask your team - consultants report finding zero active users of Insight Advisor across clients."

**"Natural language is the future"**  
"Agreed. But Qlik's version can't handle typos or plurals. That's not natural language, it's exact string matching from the 2000s."

## The Winning Pitch
"Qlik Insight Advisor fails on typos and plurals - type 'customers' instead of 'customer' and it breaks. After 5+ years, consultants report finding zero active users because it's not real AI - just rule-based pattern matching from the 2000s. At $340K+ annually, you're paying 95x more than Scoop for a feature nobody uses. Scoop provides actual natural language understanding with investigation capabilities for $3,588/year - and people actually use it."

## Proof Points
- Demo typo handling (immediate failure)
- Show plural confusion
- Ask for adoption metrics (they won't have any)
- Calculate 95x cost difference

## Competitive Intelligence
- Multiple attempts at "AI" have failed
- "Cognitive Engine" was previous failure
- Insight Advisor barely mentioned in docs
- Focus shifting to embedded analytics
- Traditional BI vendor struggling with AI transition

## Consultant Testimony
*"In 5 years of Qlik consulting, I've never seen a client successfully adopt Insight Advisor. Most try it once and never return."* - Qlik Partner Consultant
