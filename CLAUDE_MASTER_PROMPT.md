## For New Claude Session:

I need help with Scoop Analytics competitive intelligence. Please navigate to `/home/ubuntu/dev/competitive-intelligence/` and read the `AI_NAVIGATION_INDEX.md` file first. This will show you how to intelligently navigate all competitive intelligence based on my questions.

Key things to know:
- We have analyzed 12 competitors across 3 tiers
- Each competitor has detailed analysis in `tier*/[competitor-name]/README.md`
- Post-setup advantages (why users choose us daily) are critical
- I may ask you to create battle cards, sales materials, or comparisons

Please confirm you've read the navigation index and are ready to help with competitive intelligence questions.

## Alternative Shorter Version:

Please read `/home/ubuntu/dev/competitive-intelligence/AI_NAVIGATION_INDEX.md` to understand Scoop's competitive intelligence. I'll be asking questions about competitors and need you to navigate the repository intelligently.
