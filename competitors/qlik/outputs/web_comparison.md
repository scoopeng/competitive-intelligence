### The Five Pillars of Agentic Analytics

#### 1. The Digital Data Analyst Engine
Scoop functions as a complete digital data analyst that thinks, investigates, and explains like a human analyst would. When you ask "Why did sales drop?", Scoop doesn't just show you a chart—it automatically runs 3-10 related queries to find the root cause, test hypotheses, and provide evidence-based conclusions.

**How It Works:**
- **Query 1**: Identifies the magnitude and timing of the sales drop
- **Query 2**: Segments the data to find which products/regions/customers drove the change
- **Query 3**: Analyzes what was different about the affected segments
- **Query 4**: Tests correlation with external factors (seasonality, campaigns, market events)
- **Query 5**: Validates findings with similar historical patterns
- **Result**: "Sales dropped 23% due to enterprise customer churn in Q3, triggered by a 40% price increase that affected accounts with >$100K annual value"

#### 2. The In-Memory Spreadsheet Calculation Engine
Unlike Qlik's export-only Excel integration, Scoop includes a complete spreadsheet calculation engine with 150+ Excel functions.
