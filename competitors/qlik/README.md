# Qlik (Insight Advisor) - Competitive Intelligence

## Quick Summary
**Category**: IT Platform (BUA Score: 23/59, 39%)  
**Fatal Flaw**: Zero adoption - "couldn't find a single company using this"  
**Key Fact**: Can't handle typos or natural language  
**Reality Check**: Traditional BI trying to bolt on AI  

## The Scoop Advantage
- **Adoption**: Immediate use vs zero adoption after 5+ years
- **Language**: Natural conversation vs exact syntax required
- **Investigation**: Multi-step reasoning vs rigid queries
- **Independence**: Business users empowered vs developer-dependent
- **Cost**: $3,588/year vs enterprise pricing

### Sales Tools
- **[BATTLE_CARD.md](BATTLE_CARD.md)** - Complete with zero adoption evidence

### Evidence & Proof Points
| Claim | Source | Impact |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Zero adoption | Consultant reports | "Couldn't find a single company using this" |
| Available since 2019 | Qlik documentation | 5+ years, still unused |
| Can't handle typos | User feedback | One typo = query fails |
| Exact syntax required | Community forums | Not natural language |
| Developer-focused | AutoML for developers | Not business users |

## Key Differentiators

### 1. The Zero Adoption Problem (Fatal)
**Consultant Report**: "Couldn't find a single company using this in day-to-day operations"
- Available since 2019
- Predates ChatGPT boom
- 5+ years, zero traction
- **Use this quote** - it's devastating

### 2. Not Actually Natural Language
**Reality of "Natural Language"**:
- Can't handle typos
- Requires exact field names
- Rigid syntax requirements
- One mistake = failure
- Business users give up

### 3. Traditional BI with AI Veneer
- Qlik Sense = traditional dashboards
- Insight Advisor = bolted-on attempt
- AutoML = for developers only
- Not built for investigation

### 4. The Learning Curve
| Requirement | Qlik | Scoop |
|-------------|------|-------|
| Training needed | Weeks | None |
| Exact syntax | Required | Natural language |
| Typo tolerance | None | Handles naturally |
| Field names | Must know exactly | Figures it out |
| Business ready | No | Yes |

## Discovery Questions
1. "How many people actively use Insight Advisor?"
2. "What happens when users make typos?"
3. "Can business users ask questions naturally?"
4. "How much training is required?"
5. "Can it investigate WHY metrics changed?"

## Objection Handlers

**"Qlik is a leader in BI"**
→ "For traditional BI, not AI. Insight Advisor has near-zero adoption after 5+ years. Even consultants can't find anyone using it."

**"It has natural language"**
→ "That can't handle typos. One misspelling and it fails. Users need exact field names. That's not natural language."

**"It's integrated with our Qlik deployment"**
→ "But no one uses it. Ask your team. The consultant report found zero companies using Insight Advisor in daily operations."

**"Gartner recognizes Qlik"**
→ "For traditional BI, not their AI. Notice Gartner doesn't highlight Insight Advisor? There's a reason."

## The Adoption Reality Check
**Ask These Questions**:
1. "Show me your Insight Advisor usage metrics"
2. "How many queries per day?"
3. "Which teams use it regularly?"
4. Watch them struggle to find examples

## Why Zero Adoption?
1. **Too rigid**: Exact syntax required
2. **No investigation**: Can't answer "why"
3. **Training burden**: Weeks to learn
4. **Typo intolerant**: One mistake = failure
5. **Not natural**: Field names must be exact

## Competitive Landmines
- Don't attack Qlik Sense (good for dashboards)
- Focus on Insight Advisor failure
- Use the zero adoption quote
- Emphasize typo intolerance

## The Developer Focus Problem
- AutoML for developers
- Requires technical knowledge
- Not business user friendly
- Complex setup required

## Community Evidence
**From Qlik's own community**:
- "Why is Insight Advisor not more popular?"
- Multiple threads about adoption issues
- Users complaining about rigidity
- Frustration with syntax requirements

## The Typo Test (Demo This)
1. "Let's try Qlik with a typo"
2. Type: "Show me slaes by region" (sales misspelled)
3. Watch it fail completely
4. "Now watch Scoop handle it perfectly"

## The Closing Line
"After 5+ years, consultants can't find a single company using Insight Advisor in daily operations. It can't even handle typos. Would you bet on something with zero adoption, or proven technology that business users actually use?"
