## Dimension 1: Autonomy (10/20)

### Setup (4/8)
**Score**: 4/8
**Evidence**:
- "Few hours to few months" implementation timeline (Phase 2)
- Requires significant training - "Steep learning curve" (Phase 3)
- "Beginning with the Basics" tutorial needed for simple tasks (Phase 2)
- **58% certification fail rate** (BATTLE_CARD)
- "Weeks of training required" (BATTLE_CARD)
- Some drag-drop capability exists but requires understanding data models
**Source**:
- Phase 2: "Few hours to few months"
- Phase 3: "Steep learning curve for non-technical users"
- BATTLE_CARD: "58% certification fail rate"
**Reasoning**: Not instant setup but some self-service capability after extensive training. 2/4 for partial capability with training barriers, but drag-drop exists.

### Questions (4/6)
**Score**: 4/6
**Evidence**:
- Natural language via Insight Advisor Chat
- BUT: **"Cannot handle typos - one typo = query fails"** (Phase 2)
- "Requires exact field names and syntax" (Phase 2)

- **100% portal prison** - automatic 0/3
- **Manual ML** - automatic 0/3 (requires data science knowledge)
- **No schema evolution** - automatic 0/4
- **Technical data prep only** - automatic 0/2 (not business-user-accessible)
- **No writeback** - automatic 0/2
- **No presentation automation** - automatic 0/3 on Speed, 0/4 on Brand
- **Hour-long loads** - penalized Speed (1/3 only)
- **Rigid NLP** - penalized Questions (2/3 only)

**Scores Points For**:

## Validation Notes

**Score is defensible because**:
- **Hour-long loads**: Direct customer quotes from Phase 3
- **Daily crashes at 500+ users**: Documented in Phase 3
- **58% cert failure**: Cited in BATTLE_CARD with training evidence
- BUA measures business user independence - Qlik fails on training burden and performance

**This is "IT Platform"** not self-service analytics:
- Requires weeks of training with high failure rate
- Hours-long dashboard loads (not instant)
- Technical data prep required
- Manual ML configuration needed
- Legacy BI architecture with AI bolted on
- Better than dashboards due to associative model but still IT-dependent

**Why 16/50 Specifically?**:
- Higher than Zenlytic (15/50): Better investigation (3 vs 1), better interface (2 vs 2)
- Higher than Sisense (14/50): Better investigation (3 vs 1), better setup (1 vs 0)
- Higher than Power BI (14/50): Better investigation (3 vs 1) due to associative model
- Lower than ThoughtSpot (20/50): Worse performance, worse training burden
- Lower than Domo (25/50): Worse on most dimensions, no AutoML
- Much lower than Scoop (45/50): Worse on all dimensions

**Why Category C (IT Platform)?**:
- Legacy BI with associative model innovation
- Requires significant IT involvement for setup/maintenance
- Training burden with high failure rate
- Performance issues at scale (hour-long loads, crashes)
- Manual ML configuration required
- Better than pure dashboards but far from business user empowerment
- Unique investigation strength (associative model) keeps it above Category D
