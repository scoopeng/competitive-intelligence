# Qlik Research Quality Assurance Report

**QA Date**: September 26, 2025
**QA Scope**: Full documentation review and evidence verification
**QA Result**: PASSED with minor notes

## Evidence Verification Results

### ✅ Consistent Across All Documents
1. **BUPAF Score**: 16/50 (Category C) - Verified in 6 documents
2. **Market Share**: 2.36% - Consistent across all mentions
3. **500-User Crash**: "Daily crashes when user count exceeded 500" - Verified in 4 documents
4. **Hour-Long Loads**: "Up to an hour to load" - Verified in 10+ documents
5. **58% Pass Rate**: Certification failure rate - Verified in 10 documents
6. **Typo Intolerance**: "One typo = query fails" - Consistent throughout
7. **Excel Limitation**: "Cannot export formulas" - Verified across phases

### ⚠️ Minor Inconsistency Found
**TCO Figures**: Two variations exist but both are accurate:
- **$115-380K**: Base costs only (licenses, implementation, training)
- **$200-495K**: Full TCO including infrastructure and productivity loss
- **Resolution**: Both are correct, just different scopes. Battle Card uses full TCO appropriately.

## Documentation Completeness

### Phase Coverage ✅
- **Phase 0**: Archive recovery documented
- **Phase 1**: 17 searches completed, all evidence filed
- **Phase 2**: 15 searches completed, capability gaps documented
- **Phase 3**: 24 searches completed, technical reality captured
- **Phase 4**: BUPAF scoring with 25+ evidence points

## Quote Verification

### High-Impact Quotes Verified ✅
1. ✅ "Not very friendly to our users to build their own dashboards. They really depend on developers"
2. ✅ "6 months on QlikView to Qlik Sense migration supposed to take 6 weeks"
3. ✅ "Daily crashes when user count exceeded 500"
4. ✅ "Sheets and dashboards taking up to an hour to load - if they load at all"
5. ✅ "Lost sight of long-term relationships and trust"
6. ✅ "$100k a year reporting service you get free with SQL"
7. ✅ "Working as designed" (support response to issues)

## Statistical Accuracy

### Numbers Verification ✅
- **2.36%** market share - Source: 6sense data
- **58%** certification pass rate - Source: Training documentation
- **55 seconds** API timeout - Source: Technical documentation
- **500 users** crash threshold - Source: Customer reports
- **$250** certification exam cost - Source: Official pricing
- **$50-76/hour** consultant rates - Source: Industry data
- **107+ outages** - Source: StatusGator tracking
- **<50% POC success** - Source: Industry research

## Evidence Strength Assessment

### Strong Evidence (Multiple Sources)
- Performance issues (10+ sources)
- Training requirements (8+ sources)
- Cost analysis (6+ sources)
- Excel limitations (5+ sources)
- NLP failures (5+ sources)

### Medium Evidence (2-4 Sources)
- POC failure rates (industry-wide data)
- Market share decline (limited recent data)
- Customer exodus claims (indirect evidence)

### Weak Evidence (Single Source)
- Some specific error messages
- Individual consultant quotes
- Specific implementation timelines

## Research Methodology Validation

### Strengths ✅
1. **Systematic Approach**: 4-phase methodology followed exactly
2. **Documentation**: Every search documented with results
3. **Evidence Trail**: All claims traceable to sources
4. **Balance**: Positive aspects noted where found
5. **Current Data**: 2024-2025 sources prioritized

### Areas for Improvement
1. Could use more direct customer interviews
2. Pricing remains opaque for enterprise
3. Some reliance on community forums vs official sources
4. Limited access to internal Qlik metrics

## Competitive Positioning Accuracy

### Claims Verified ✅
- Scoop 30-second setup vs Qlik months ✅
- Scoop no training vs Qlik weeks + certification ✅
- Scoop Excel support vs Qlik static export ✅
- Scoop typo-tolerant vs Qlik exact match ✅
- Scoop multi-pass vs Qlik single query ✅

### Market Context Accurate ✅
- Power BI dominance confirmed (13.84% share)
- Tableau visualization superiority acknowledged
- ThoughtSpot ease of use advantage documented
- Gartner Leader status noted (but contextualized)

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Claims (Highly Defensible)
- Training requirements and certification stats
- Performance issues and load times
- Excel formula export limitations
- Typo intolerance in NLP
- Hidden cost calculations

### Medium Risk Claims (Defensible with Context)
- Market share trends
- POC success rates
- Customer satisfaction levels
- Migration difficulty

### High Risk Claims (Avoid or Caveat)
- "Zero adoption" of AI features (consultant anecdote)
- Specific customer counts (third-party estimates)
- Future predictions about Qlik

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Use ✅
1. All performance metrics are verified and usable
2. Training and certification stats are accurate
3. Cost analysis is conservative and defensible
4. Technical limitations are well-documented
5. Customer quotes are authentic and impactful

### For Sales Team
1. Use full TCO ($200-495K) for impact
2. Demo typo failure as proof point
3. Reference 58% certification failure rate
4. Emphasize hour-long load times
5. Show 2.36% market share for context

### For Future Research
1. Get direct enterprise pricing quotes
2. Find more recent customer churn data
3. Gather Qlik Cloud-specific limitations
4. Track impact of Fitch downgrade
5. Monitor for product updates/improvements

## Final QA Verdict

**APPROVED FOR USE**

This research meets enterprise standards for competitive intelligence:
- ✅ Evidence-based (every claim has source)
- ✅ Comprehensive (56 searches, 4 phases)
- ✅ Current (2024-2025 sources)
- ✅ Balanced (strengths acknowledged)
- ✅ Actionable (clear sales enablement)
- ✅ Verifiable (sources documented)

The minor TCO figure variation is not a concern as both numbers are accurate for their respective scopes. The research provides overwhelming evidence that Qlik fails to deliver business user empowerment, with a mountain of technical, economic, and user experience issues that create clear opportunities for Scoop.

**Confidence Level**: HIGH
**Recommendation**: Use aggressively in competitive situations
