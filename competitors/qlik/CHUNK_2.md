# CHUNK 2: Technical Reality & Competitive Context (30-35 minutes)

## YOUR MISSION
Document technical limitations with quantified data and position in competitive landscape.

## PHASE 2A: Technical Performance Analysis (12-15 minutes)

### Performance Quantification
1. "Qlik slow performance response time seconds query"
2. "Qlik memory requirements GB RAM crashes"
3. "Qlik concurrent users limit scalability testing"
4. "Qlik database timeout connection errors"
5. "Qlik uptime downtime SLA breach outage"

**Goal**: Get specific numbers - response times, memory needs, user limits, uptime stats

### Integration Reality Check
6. "Qlik API rate limits throttling developers"
7. "Qlik SSO integration broken SAML authentication"
8. "Qlik mobile app terrible performance user"
9. "Qlik embedding iframe security CSP issues"
10. "Qlik REST API documentation incomplete missing"

**Focus**: Real developer pain points, integration failures, technical debt

## PHASE 2B: Competitive Positioning Research (10-12 minutes)

### Direct Competitive Intelligence
11. "Qlik vs Tableau why customers switch"
12. "Qlik vs ThoughtSpot RFP evaluation lost deal"
13. "Qlik vs Qlik comparison customers choose alternative"
14. "Qlik losing market share declining adoption 2024 2025"

### Analyst & Market Intelligence
15. "Qlik Gartner customers complain disappointed"
16. "Qlik Forrester critical assessment limitations"
17. "Qlik analyst report customer feedback negative"

### Total Cost of Ownership Reality
18. "Qlik hidden costs professional services implementation"
19. "Qlik training required weeks months learning curve"
20. "Qlik consultant fees implementation partner expensive"
21. "Qlik maintenance overhead admin full-time required"

### ROI and Value Realization
22. "Qlik time to value months delayed insights"
23. "Qlik ROI negative failed to deliver business value"
24. "Qlik opportunity cost manual reporting workarounds"

**Focus**: True costs beyond licenses, delayed value realization
