# Qlik Customer Implementation Stories

## Horror Stories & Failed Implementations

### The 6-Month Migration Nightmare
**Source**: Community forums
**Story**: A company spent "6 months on a QlikView to Qlik Sense migration that was supposed to take 6 weeks". The migration resulted in "broken dashboards and lost functionality" that took additional months to fix.
**Impact**: 10x timeline overrun, broken functionality, additional remediation costs

### The 500-User Crash Crisis
**Source**: Reddit discussions
**Story**: An organization experienced "daily crashes when user count exceeded 500". Despite being sold as an enterprise solution, the system couldn't handle moderate user loads.
**Impact**: Daily business disruption, user frustration, productivity loss

### The Hour-Long Dashboard Wait
**Source**: Capterra reviews
**Story**: Users report "sheets and dashboards taking up to an hour to load - if they load at all". When filters are applied, "it has to re-pull the report, causing those minutes to be lost again".
**Impact**: Users abandon the tool, revert to Excel, wasted investment

### The Debug Nightmare
**Source**: Community discussions
**Story**: One developer mentioned spending "weeks trying to debug a simple data model issue" due to poor error messages from Qlik.
**Impact**: Weeks of developer time for simple issues, project delays

## Customer Frustration Quotes

### On Business User Empowerment
> "Not very friendly to our users to build their own dashboards. They really depend on the developers to do the coding and develop these dashboards"

> "If only a handful of specialists can operate it effectively, your organization misses the real upside of BI: giving business users direct access to insight"

> "Your data team is acting as a reporting service desk. If stakeholders are still emailing you to update dashboards or tweak metrics, your BI tool isn't enabling self-service"

### On Support Experience
> "Support tickets would take weeks to get a response, only to be told it's 'working as designed'"

> "Turn-around time for customer support can be longer than expected, and at times even the internal team isn't able to provide complete diagnosis"

### On Learning Curve
> "It's a paradigm shift from traditional BI tools"

> "The coding of equations is quite complicated"

> "I struggle a lot with customization"

> "Qlik Sense needs some technical knowledge to understand it completely"

### On Performance
> "Reports can take multiple minutes to load, and once any filters are applied, it has to re-pull the report, causing those minutes to be lost again"

> "When working with a lot of information lines or put too much formulas into a report it will limit how you can export it"

> "Excessive memory usage in analysis mode that slows processing"

## Consultant Perspectives

### On Client Expectations vs Reality
> "Fulfilling the dream shown by SALES dept and fulfilling commitments given by the Pre-SALES dept"

This consultant highlights the gap between what's sold and what's delivered.

### On Knowledge Gaps
> "Your system's slow performance stems from a shortage of knowledge among your developers"

Consultants acknowledge that even with training, many teams lack the expertise to optimize Qlik properly.

### On Implementation Complexity
> "Constructing a Scorecard or performance management with unstable KPIs"

Listed as the biggest challenge in QlikView development by experienced consultants.

### Warning About Client Training
> "Don't teach clients basic QlikView fundamentals too early, as they start thinking that they know everything and then the demands start related to project timelines"

## Switching Decisions

### Moving to Competitors
**From a former Looker user about Sigma Computing**:
> "A HUGE improvement over that tool with better ease of use, clarity of features, flexibility"

**General preference order from reviewer**:
> "Overall, I would choose Power BI, Tableau then Qlik Sense"

### Why Organizations Leave
> "If you're a growing SaaS team, Qlik often feels like using a forklift when you just need a hand truck"

> "Try that with Qlik and you'll be stuck in setup mode for days. Setup takes less than 30 minutes â€” Qlik took hours"

> "Your stack is modern, but Qlik isn't keeping up. You're using dbt, storing everything in Snowflake or BigQuery, and version-controlling models in Git. Qlik's proprietary scripting and limited Git integration mean it often sits outside the flow of your modern analytics workflows"

## Employee Retention Issues

### The Non-Compete Problem
**Source**: LinkedIn - ThoughtSpot post
> "Qlik customers, partners, and employees are leaving in droves for ThoughtSpot"

> "Qlik requires an extremely broad, complicated non-compete agreement that prohibits them from joining any other company in a similar space for an entire 12 months once they leave Qlik"

> "Qlik couldn't beat us by playing by the rules of capitalism. They couldn't match our speed of innovation or growth with customers"

## Implementation Partner Challenges

### Scope Creep Reality
> "With time & materials projects, clients can get caught in a cycle of constantly doing 'one more thing', particularly with Qlik's flexible platform"

### Skills Gap
> "Service providers may experience delays due to lack of specific skills required to address complex Qlik challenges, leading to longer timelines"

### Data Quality Blame Game
> "Data not being of sufficient quality becomes the client's responsibility but may require additional consulting engagements"

## Cost Shock Stories

### Scaling Costs
> "Too expensive to scale to hundred - thousands users"

> "Qlik Sense is quite expensive compared to other tools existing in the field such as Tableau"

### Hidden Costs
> "Using Qlik consultants may be more expensive than training your own team, but it pays off since you won't have to remediate poorly coded applications or fix other mistakes made during implementation"

The implication: You either pay high consultant fees upfront or pay even more to fix problems later.

## Industry-Specific Challenges

### Mobile/Tablet Issues
> "Features malfunctioning in iOS"
> "Screen size adjustment problems on mobile devices like iPads and phones"

### Language Support Failures
> "The storytelling feature has limitations with languages like Japanese and Chinese not being fully supported"
> "The server fails to handle Japanese and Chinese characters properly"

### Security Glitches
> "Unauthorized access being granted to users as a result of technical glitches in the Qlik Sense Server"

## The Age Problem
> "The biggest shortfall of Qlik Sense is its age"

Despite attempts to modernize, users feel the platform shows its legacy architecture.
