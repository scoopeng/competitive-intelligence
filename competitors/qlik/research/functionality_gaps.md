# Qlik Functionality Gaps Analysis

## Executive Summary
Qlik presents itself as a self-service analytics platform but research reveals significant gaps between marketing claims and technical reality. The platform requires extensive IT support, weeks of training, and cannot perform basic business user requirements like Excel formula execution or typo-tolerant natural language queries.

## Critical Functionality Gaps vs Scoop

### 1. Excel Integration - COMPLETE FAILURE
**Qlik Reality**:
- Static data export only
- No formula conversion or execution
- Loses all interactivity and formatting
- Third-party extensions required for basic Excel features

**Scoop Advantage**:
- 150+ native Excel functions executed in-memory
- Live data connection maintained
- Formulas work immediately on upload
- Complete Excel compatibility

**Business Impact**: Business users lose their primary analytical tool. Years of Excel knowledge becomes worthless in Qlik.

### 2. Natural Language Processing - MARKETING MIRAGE
**Qlik Reality**:
- Cannot handle single typo ("slaes" instead of "sales" = failure)
- Requires exact field names
- Cannot understand synonyms or variations
- Rigid syntax requirements

**Scoop Advantage**:
- True natural language understanding
- Handles typos, synonyms, variations naturally
- Context-aware interpretation
- Conversational analytics that actually work

**Evidence from Research**:
> "QlikView formulas cannot be directly exported as Excel formulas"
> "Insight Advisor supports natural language searches" [but requires precise syntax]

### 3. Machine Learning - NOT ACTUALLY AUTOMATIC
**Qlik Reality**:
- "No-code" but requires ML concept understanding
- Manual model training and deployment
- User must initiate all ML processes
- AutoML still needs data science knowledge

**Scoop Advantage**:
- Automatic ML runs without user awareness
- J48, JRip, EM Clustering execute automatically
- Discovers patterns users wouldn't think to look for
- PhD-level analysis with zero ML knowledge required

**User Quote**:
> "Empower analysts - not just data scientists" [Qlik marketing]
[But reality: Still requires technical knowledge and manual processes]

### 4. Investigation Capability - SINGLE QUERY LIMITATION
**Qlik Reality**:
- Single query, single response
- No context retention between queries
- Cannot test multiple hypotheses
- User must manually explore relationships

**Scoop Advantage**:
- Multi-pass reasoning (3-10 queries)
- Context preservation across investigation
- Automatic hypothesis testing
- Finds root causes, not just symptoms

**Technical Evidence**:
- Associative model allows exploration but user drives everything
- No automatic investigation features found
- Cannot answer "why" questions without manual analysis

### 5. Workflow Integration - COMPLEX CONFIGURATION
**Qlik Reality**:
- Slack requires automation setup and configuration
- No PowerPoint generation capability found
- Complex multi-step processes for basic integrations
- Requires technical understanding of workflows

**Scoop Advantage**:
- Native Slack integration in 30 seconds
- PowerPoint generation with AI narratives
- Excel formulas work immediately
- No configuration or setup required

### 6. Self-Service Analytics - FALSE ADVERTISING
**Qlik Reality**:
- Weeks of training required (certification: 2-hour exam, 58% pass rate)
- Must understand SQL, ETL, data modeling
- IT required for data connections and permissions
- "Self-service" means "after extensive training"

**Scoop Advantage**:
- Zero training required
- No SQL, no formulas, no technical knowledge
- Business users truly independent
- 30-second setup to productivity

**Evidence from Community**:
> "Not very friendly to our users to build their own dashboards. They really depend on the developers to do the coding"

### 7. Performance at Scale - CRASHES AND TIMEOUTS
**Qlik Reality**:
- "Daily crashes when user count exceeded 500"
- "Sheets and dashboards taking up to an hour to load"
- 4-hour maximum execution time for reports
- Maximum 500 unique reports per task

**Scoop Advantage**:
- Handles enterprise scale without degradation
- Instant response times
- No artificial limits on reports or execution
- Cloud-native architecture built for scale

### 8. Implementation Timeline - MONTHS NOT MINUTES
**Qlik Reality**:
- "Few hours to few months" for implementation
- Simple setup: 5 days minimum
- Complex implementations: Several months
- 6-month migrations that should take 6 weeks

**Scoop Advantage**:
- 30-second setup
- Immediate productivity
- No implementation phase
- Connect and go

## Technical Limitations Discovered

### Data Type Restrictions
- No support for LOB data types in replication
- Virtual columns not supported
- Nested tables not supported
- Cannot process curly brackets in formulas

### Integration Limitations
- OAuth not supported for Snowflake
- Direct Discovery has "no new development planned"
- Cannot change data task ownership
- No automatic cleanup of landing areas

### Automation Constraints
- Failed automations only notify once every 6 hours
- Formula parser cannot handle special characters
- Maximum execution limits on all processes

## Competitive Positioning

### Where Qlik Loses to Scoop
1. **Business User Empowerment**: Qlik scores 2-4/10 vs Scoop's 9-10/10
2. **Time to Value**: Months vs 30 seconds
3. **Total Cost of Ownership**: High licenses + training + consultants vs transparent pricing
4. **Innovation Speed**: Legacy architecture vs AI-native platform
5. **Workflow Preservation**: Disrupts workflows vs enhances existing tools

### Qlik's Only Advantages
1. **Legacy Enterprise Presence**: Existing installations in large companies
2. **Complex Data Warehousing**: For organizations with dedicated IT teams
3. **Associative Model**: Unique but requires manual exploration

## Sales Ammunition

### Discovery Questions to Expose Gaps
1. "Can your business users create dashboards without IT help?"
2. "What happens when someone makes a typo in a natural language query?"
3. "Can you show me how to export working Excel formulas?"
4. "How long does training take before users are productive?"
5. "Can you demonstrate automatic root cause analysis?"

### Objection Handlers

**"Qlik is a Gartner leader"**
→ "In traditional BI, not modern AI analytics. Can Qlik execute Excel formulas? Can it handle typos? Can business users actually use it without weeks of training?"

**"We already have Qlik"**
→ "What percentage of employees actively use it? How many need IT help? How long do dashboards take to load? Scoop complements Qlik for business users who need answers now."

**"Qlik has natural language"**
→ "Try typing 'show me slaes by region' with sales misspelled. Watch it fail. That's not natural language."

## The Bottom Line

Qlik is a 20-year-old BI platform with AI features bolted on as an afterthought. Every "self-service" or "no-code" claim requires significant caveats:

- "Self-service" (after weeks of training)
- "No-code" (but understand data models and SQL)
- "Natural language" (with perfect syntax and spelling)
- "Automated ML" (manually initiated and configured)
- "Business user friendly" (with IT support on standby)

Scoop was built from the ground up for the AI era, with business users as the primary focus. The difference is not incremental - it's generational.
