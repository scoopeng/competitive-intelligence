# Domo Research Checklist - Complete Protocol

**Time**: 90-120 minutes for comprehensive, evidence-based competitive intelligence
**Quality**: Enterprise-grade with implementation stories, quantified data, and research library

## üî¥ CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS

### 1. CHECK EXISTING RESEARCH FIRST
**Before running ANY search, check the Research Library section below to see if it's already been done**
- If a search is already documented with good results, SKIP IT (check the box and move on)
- If a search was done but returned no/poor results, you MAY retry it
- This prevents duplicate work and saves time

### 2. DOCUMENT AS YOU GO
**Document EVERY URL you visit in the Research Library section at the bottom of this file AS YOU GO**
- Don't wait until the end - add each URL immediately after visiting
- Include searches that return no results
- This creates your evidence trail and source documentation

### 3. HANDLE EDGE CASES
- **Paywalled content**: Try cache:URL in Google, archive.org, or note as "Paywalled - could not access"
- **No results**: After 3 failed searches in a section, try broader terms or competitor's parent company
- **Time management**: If Phase 1 exceeds 50 minutes, prioritize remaining high-value searches
- **Conflicting evidence**: Document both viewpoints in NOTES section with sources
