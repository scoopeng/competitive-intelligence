# CHUNK 2: Technical Reality & Competitive Context (30-35 minutes)

## YOUR MISSION
Document technical limitations with quantified data and position in competitive landscape.

## PHASE 2A: Technical Performance Analysis (12-15 minutes)

### Performance Quantification
1. "Domo slow performance response time seconds query"
2. "Domo memory requirements GB RAM crashes"
3. "Domo concurrent users limit scalability testing"
4. "Domo database timeout connection errors"
5. "Domo uptime downtime SLA breach outage"

**Goal**: Get specific numbers - response times, memory needs, user limits, uptime stats

### Integration Reality Check
6. "Domo API rate limits throttling developers"
7. "Domo SSO integration broken SAML authentication"
8. "Domo mobile app terrible performance user"
9. "Domo embedding iframe security CSP issues"
10. "Domo REST API documentation incomplete missing"

**Focus**: Real developer pain points, integration failures, technical debt

## PHASE 2B: Competitive Positioning Research (10-12 minutes)

### Direct Competitive Intelligence
11. "Domo vs Tableau why customers switch"
12. "Domo vs PowerBI RFP evaluation lost deal"
13. "Domo vs Qlik comparison customers choose alternative"
14. "Domo losing market share declining adoption 2024 2025"

### Analyst & Market Intelligence
15. "Domo Gartner customers complain disappointed"
16. "Domo Forrester critical assessment limitations"
17. "Domo analyst report customer feedback negative"

**Goal**: Position in market context, understand competitive losses

## PHASE 2C: Economic Impact Deep Dive (8-10 minutes)

### Total Cost of Ownership Reality
18. "Domo hidden costs professional services implementation"
19. "Domo training required weeks months learning curve"
20. "Domo consultant fees implementation partner expensive"
21. "Domo maintenance overhead admin full-time required"

### ROI and Value Realization
22. "Domo time to value months delayed insights"
23. "Domo ROI negative failed to deliver business value"
24. "Domo opportunity cost manual reporting workarounds"

**Focus**: True costs beyond licenses, delayed value realization
