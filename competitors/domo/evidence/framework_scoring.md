### Questions (4/6)
**Score**: 4/6
**Evidence**:
- Natural language query capability exists (SHIFT Technology, Pramana Labs NLP)
- AI Chat provides conversational interface
- BUT: Dashboard-first architecture - can only query within dashboards IT built
- Single query responses, no follow-up investigation
- "Questions you didn't know to ask" marketing but limited capability
**Source**: Phase 2 functionality analysis, Domo platform documentation
**Reasoning**: Good NL interface but constrained to pre-built dashboards. Not truly flexible.

### Speed (4/6)
**Score**: 4/6
**Evidence**:
- Fast once loaded (5-30 seconds typical)
- Dashboard performance is reasonable after setup
**Source**: BATTLE_CARD, community feedback
**Reasoning**: Fast results once configured.

### Time to First Insight (3/6) ⭐ NEW
**Score**: 3/6
**Evidence**:
- Requires IT setup and semantic modeling first (days/weeks)
- Once configured, users get insights quickly (<1 hour)
- "Implementation took 3 months" (G2 reviews)
**Reasoning**: Faster than most traditional BI once set up, but initial setup takes time.

### Governed Self-Service (2/3) ⭐ NEW
**Score**: 2/3
**Evidence**:
- Has governance features (permissions, row-level security)
- Not foolproof - users can create uncontrolled content
- Social layer allows sharing but governance is opt-in
**Reasoning**: Good governance but not enterprise-grade like ThoughtSpot/Qlik.

**Total Autonomy**: 15/20

  - "Domo disables any formulas in Excel files before export"
  - Static export only (download, edit, re-upload cycle)
  - 1M row limit, 25K for Mega Tables
- **Slack**: No native integration - requires third-party (Workato, n8n)
- **PowerPoint**: Office Add-in exists but manual insert one visual at a time
- **vs Scoop**: No =DOMO() formulas, no live data, no native Slack
**Source**:
- https://knowledge.domo.com/Engage/Sharing_Content_in_Domo/Using_the_Domo_Excel_Plugin
- Phase 2 functionality analysis
**Reasoning**: Excel integration exists but crippled (no formulas). Major workflow gap.

### Portal Prison (0/6)
**Score**: 0/6
**Evidence**:
- Dashboard-first architecture forces portal dependency
- AI Chat only works within portal on pre-built dashboards
- Cannot work independently in Excel (formulas disabled)
- Must log into Domo for all analysis

## Key Evidence

**Cost Reality**:
- "$134,000 average annual" documented
- "1% of company revenue" (actual customer quote)
- "1120% renewal increase" documented case
- $95,800 for 100 users (not advertised $10K)
- Consumption pricing drives unpredictable costs

**Excel Integration Failure**:
- "Domo disables any formulas in Excel files before export" (official docs)
- Windows-only plugin
- Static download/upload cycle (not live)
- 1M row limit, 25K for Mega Tables

**Performance Issues**:
- "30-60 seconds to open analyzer" (community forums)
- "Coffee break to open" per BATTLE_CARD
- Slow compared to modern cloud platforms

**Dashboard Dependency**:
- AI Chat only works within dashboards
- Cannot investigate across sources
- "Dashboard narration, not investigation"

---

## Validation Notes

**Score is defensible because**:
- Domo IS better at visualization (Dresner #1) - properly scored high
- Dashboard-first IS a legitimate architecture for some use cases
- BUA measures business user independence, not BI platform maturity
- 25/50 accurately reflects "good BI platform, limited autonomy"

**This is "Good Platform"** with some business user capability:
- IT builds dashboards → Business users consume → AI Chat narrates
- Some self-service capability but requires setup
- Designed for governed analytics, not autonomous investigation

**Note**: Score updated from 59-point system (33/59) to 100-point system (62/100). All component scores proportionally scaled to maintain relative positioning.
