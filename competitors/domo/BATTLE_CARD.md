# Battle Card: Domo

**BUA Score**: 33/59 (56%, Category B - Analyst Workbench)
**Market Position**: Portal-centric BI requiring IT support
**Key Weaknesses**: Excel formulas disabled, no investigation, 1% of revenue cost

---

## Quick Win Discovery Questions
1. "Can you use Excel formulas with live Domo data?"
2. "How long does it take to open the analyzer?"
3. "What's your actual annual cost including professional services?"

## Killer Facts (Evidence-Based)
- **Excel formulas disabled** - Official documentation confirms
- **1% of company revenue** - Actual customer quote
- **1120% renewal increase** - Documented case
- **30-60 seconds** to open analyzer - Community forums
- **$95,800 for 100 users** - Not the advertised $10K
- **No investigation** - Single SQL queries only

## Head-to-Head

| Factor | Domo | Scoop | Your Win |
|--------|------|-------|----------|
| Excel Formulas | ❌ Disabled | ✅ 150+ functions | "They disable formulas for security" |
| Investigation | ❌ Single query | ✅ 3-10 probes | "Can't answer WHY" |
| True Cost (100 users) | $95,800+ | $3,588 | "27x more expensive" |
| Setup Time | 1-2 months | 30 seconds | "Months vs seconds" |
| CSV Upload | Workbench required | Drag & drop | "Windows-only tool needed" |
| Performance | 30-60 sec loads | Instant | "Coffee break to open" |

## Objection Handlers

**"Domo is #1 in self-service BI"**  
"For dashboards, yes. But AI Chat only works within existing dashboards. You need IT to build views first. That's not self-service - that's dashboard service."

**"We like the AI Chat feature"**  
"Which only works with data already in dashboards. Can't investigate across sources or explore beyond what IT built. It's dashboard narration, not investigation."

**"They have 1000+ connectors"**  
"Having connectors and using them are different. Each requires configuration, and AI Chat can't query across them - only within dashboards."

## Workflow Integration Gap

**Domo Reality**: Portal prison - everything requires logging into Domo
- No =SCOOP() style Excel formulas - just static exports
- No live PowerPoint data - screenshot and paste for hours
- No native Slack - must leave conversation to check portal

**Scoop Advantage**: Work in YOUR tools
- Native Excel formulas that refresh
- Live PowerPoint generation in 30 seconds
- Full investigation in Slack

**Time Impact**: 3+ hours manual work per report for Domo users

## The Winning Pitch
"Domo requires you to build dashboards before AI Chat can work - it's dashboard-first, not insight-first. With average costs of $134,000/year and documented renewal increases up to 1120%, you're locked into consumption pricing that spirals out of control. Their AI Chat shows you SQL for your dashboards but can't investigate WHY metrics changed across your business. Scoop starts with investigation, handles schema changes automatically, and costs $3,588/year flat - no surprises, no dashboards required."

## Proof Points
- Show dashboard dependency
- Document renewal shock stories
- Demonstrate investigation vs SQL display
- Calculate consumption vs flat pricing

## Competitive Intelligence
- #1 in Dresner study (for dashboards)
- Mr. Roboto is statistics from 2017
- Heavy services component
- Consumption model drives revenue
- "Business users find it complicated"
