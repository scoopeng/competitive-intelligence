## 5. INVESTIGATION VS DASHBOARD NARRATION

### Understanding the AI Chat Limitation

**What Domo AI Chat Does:**
Domo's AI Chat represents their attempt to modernize dashboard consumption through natural language interaction. The system provides:

- **Natural language interface** to existing dashboard data
- **SQL query transparency** - shows the generated SQL for user verification
- **Dashboard context awareness** - understands the semantic model IT built
- **Single-query responses** within predefined dashboard scope
- **Data explanation** - can explain what metrics mean within dashboard context

**What It Cannot Do:**
The fundamental limitation lies in Domo's dashboard-first architecture:

- **Cannot investigate WHY metrics changed** across business functions
- **Cannot explore beyond dashboards** IT pre-built with semantic models
- **No multi-pass reasoning** - each query is independent without context retention
- **No cross-source investigation** - limited to data sources already dashboarded
- **No hypothesis testing** - cannot form and test theories about data patterns
- **No root cause drilling** - can show correlations but not causal relationships

**The Architecture Constraint:**
Domo AI Chat operates within the semantic layer constraints. If IT didn't build a dashboard view connecting customer demographics with product performance with regional sales, AI Chat cannot investigate across those dimensions. This is not a limitation of AI Chat technology - it's an inevitable result of dashboard-first architecture.

### Scoop's Multi-Pass Investigation Engine

**The Investigation Philosophy:**
Scoop starts with the assumption that business users need to investigate "why" questions that cross multiple data sources and require context-aware reasoning. Unlike dashboard narration, investigation involves:

- **Hypothesis formation** based on business context
- **Evidence gathering** across multiple data sources
- **Context retention** between queries to build comprehensive understanding
- **Theory testing** with statistical validation
- **Root cause identification** with confidence scoring

**How Investigation Works - Detailed Example:**
```
User: "Why did sales drop in Q4?"

Investigation Process:

Query 1: "When exactly did the drop occur?"
- Analysis: Daily sales data Sept-Dec
- Finding: Sharp 23% decline starting October 15th
- Context Retained: Timing precision for correlation analysis

Query 2: "Which customer segments were affected?"
- Analysis: Segment performance comparison (Enterprise, Mid-market, SMB)
- Finding: Enterprise down 34%, Mid-market down 8%, SMB up 12%
- Context Retained: Enterprise segment as primary driver

Query 3: "What's unique about affected Enterprise customers?"
- Analysis: Enterprise customer characteristics and behaviors
- Finding: Northeast region accounts for 67% of Enterprise decline
- Context Retained: Geographic concentration pattern

Query 4: "What changed in Northeast Enterprise market on Oct 15th?"
- Analysis: External market events, competitor activity, product launches
- Finding: Major competitor launched competitive product Oct 12th
- Context Retained: Competitor timing correlation established

Query 5: "How did our Northeast customers respond to competitor launch?"
- Analysis: Customer behavior changes, inquiry patterns, churn indicators
- Finding: 43% of Northeast Enterprise increased competitor evaluation
- Context Retained: Competitive displacement confirmed

Query 6: "Which specific product features drove customer consideration?"
- Analysis: Sales call notes, competitive analysis, feature comparisons
- Finding: Competitor's new ML capability addressing compliance gap
- Context Retained: Feature-specific competitive threat identified

Query 7: "What other regions show similar vulnerability?"
- Analysis: Regional analysis for similar customer profiles and competitive exposure
- Finding: Southeast and West Coast show 67% customer profile overlap
- Context Retained: Expansion threat assessment

Final Synthesis: "High-value Enterprise customers in Northeast
reduced orders by 34% starting October 15th, three days after
Competitor X launched their ML compliance feature. This addresses
a gap in our offering that affects 67% of Northeast Enterprise
accounts. Similar vulnerability exists in Southeast (43 accounts)
and West Coast (38 accounts). Immediate response needed on ML
compliance roadmap and targeted retention program for 127 vulnerable
Enterprise accounts. Estimated revenue at risk: $2.3M annually."
```

**Investigation Features in Detail:**

**Multi-Pass Reasoning:**
- **3-10 queries per investigation** with each building on previous findings
- **Context preservation** - every query has access to previous findings
- **Hypothesis evolution** - theories are refined based on evidence
- **Evidence weighting** - stronger evidence influences investigation direction
- **Confidence scoring** - final recommendations include statistical confidence

**Cross-Source Analysis:**
- **Automatic data joining** across sources without predefined relationships
- **Schema inference** - understands data relationships dynamically
- **Temporal correlation** - identifies timing relationships across events
- **External data integration** - incorporates market data, competitor intelligence

**Business Logic Integration:**
- **Industry knowledge** - understands business concepts and terminology
- **Seasonal adjustments** - accounts for cyclical business patterns
- **Metric relationships** - understands how KPIs influence each other
- **Action prioritization** - recommends next steps based on findings

**Statistical Validation:**

## 21. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### Executive Summary

Domo represents the pinnacle of dashboard-centric business intelligence, earning our highest competitor score of 62/100 for legitimate reasons: strong visualization, real AutoML capabilities, comprehensive connectors, and mature enterprise features. However, its dashboard-first architecture creates fundamental limitations for business user autonomy.

**The Core Difference:**
- **Domo**: IT builds dashboards → Business users consume → AI Chat narrates

### The Respectful Reality

Domo has built an impressive platform that serves dashboard-centric organizations well. Their #1 Dresner ranking, real AutoML capabilities, and comprehensive connector ecosystem represent genuine technical achievements. The 62/100 BUA score reflects these strengths appropriately.

However, for organizations prioritizing business user autonomy, investigation capabilities, and native tool integration, Scoop's architecture provides fundamental advantages that cannot be replicated through dashboard enhancement or AI Chat overlays.

### Final Recommendation

**For Dashboard-Centric Organizations**: Domo remains a strong choice with proven enterprise capabilities and sophisticated visualization.

**For Investigation-Driven Organizations**: Scoop provides unique capabilities (multi-pass investigation, Excel integration, schema evolution) that address business user empowerment directly.

**For Cost-Conscious Organizations**: Scoop's 96% cost reduction ($134K to $3.6K annually) with superior investigation capabilities presents compelling ROI.

**For Workflow-Focused Organizations**: Scoop's native Excel, PowerPoint, and Slack integration eliminates the workflow disruption inherent in portal-based solutions.

The choice between Domo and Scoop ultimately reflects your organization's analytical philosophy: consumption-focused dashboards with IT governance, or investigation-driven insights with business user empowerment.
