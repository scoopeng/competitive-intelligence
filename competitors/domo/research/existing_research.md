# Existing Domo Research Summary
**Date**: September 25, 2025
**Purpose**: Document existing research before executing new template phases

## Current Research Status

### What We Already Know Well
1. **Portal Prison Concept** - Well established
   - Everything trapped in Domo UI
   - No native Slack/Excel integration
   - Must log into portal for all work

2. **AI Chat Capabilities** - Deep dive completed
   - Can query datasets directly (not just dashboards)
   - Single queries only - no investigation capability
   - Shows SQL transparency
   - Requires AI Readiness metadata setup

3. **Pricing Model** - Documented
   - $134,000/year average enterprise cost
   - Consumption-based pricing chaos
   - 1120% renewal increase documented case
   - Hidden costs in professional services

4. **Scoop vs Domo Advantages** - Comprehensive analysis done
   - Data upload: 30-second CSV vs Workbench installation
   - Workflow: Native Slack/Excel/PPT vs portal-only
   - Investigation: 3-10 probes vs single queries
   - ML: Data Science Studio vs 2017 statistics
   - Time to value: Immediate vs 1-2 months

### What Needs More Research

1. **Customer Stories & Implementation Horror Stories**
   - Need specific quotes from G2, Capterra, Reddit
   - Industry-specific limitations (healthcare, finance, retail)
   - Switching decisions and reasons

2. **Functionality Deep Dive with Scoop Comparison**
   - Detailed capability-by-capability comparison
   - Excel integration specifics
   - ML/AI actual capabilities vs claims
   - Root cause analysis capabilities

3. **Technical Performance & Integration Issues**
   - Quantified performance metrics
   - API limitations and throttling
   - Mobile app issues
   - SSO/authentication problems

4. **Competitive Win/Loss Analysis**
   - Why customers choose alternatives
   - Lost deals to other platforms
   - Market share trends

## Existing Evidence Quality

### Strong Evidence
- AI Chat technical capabilities
- Portal prison architecture
- Basic pricing structure

### Weak/Missing Evidence
- Customer quotes and stories
- Performance metrics
- Integration failure examples
- Industry-specific issues

## Key Findings to Validate/Update
1. Mr. Roboto still just 2017 statistics?
2. 14+ weeks implementation typical?
3. Dashboard dependency for AI Chat (nuanced - not required but best results with setup)
4. Workbench Windows-only requirement still true?
5. 100MB per sheet limit accurate?

## Notes for New Research
- Focus on capability differences, not market presence
- Document both Scoop advantages AND Domo-specific pain points
- Emphasize: Excel engine, multi-pass investigation, automatic ML, 30-second setup
- Avoid: Review count comparisons, funding comparisons
