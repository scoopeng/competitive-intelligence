## Key Differentiators

### 1. Portal Prison (Their Architecture Trap)
- **Everything trapped in Domo**: Can't get insights out to where work happens
- **No Excel integration**: Export only, no live formulas
- **No Slack/Teams**: Must log into Domo portal
- **Demo this**: "Show me Domo insights in Excel" (they can't)

### 2. Cost Reality
| Component | Domo | Scoop |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Base Platform | $83/user/month | $299/month unlimited |
| AI Features | +20% premium | Included |
| Implementation | $50K+ | $0 |
| Annual (200 users) | $134,000+ | $3,588 |

### 3. Dashboard Builder vs Investigation Engine
- **Domo**: Powerful dashboard creation platform
- **Scoop**: Automatic investigation and root cause analysis
- **Reality**: They're for data teams, we're for business users

## What to Acknowledge
- Domo AI Chat CAN query datasets directly (not just dashboards)
- Strong data pipeline and ETL capabilities
- Good for organizations with dedicated data teams
- Beast Mode for complex calculations

## Discovery Questions
1. "Can you access Domo insights in Excel or Slack?"
2. "What's your all-in annual cost including AI features?"
3. "How long does it take to build a new dashboard?"
4. "Can business users upload and analyze spreadsheets themselves?"

## Objection Handlers

**"Domo has AI chat that queries data"**
→ "Yes, but only inside their portal. Can you put Domo insights in Excel? In Slack? In PowerPoint? That's the portal prison - insights trapped where work doesn't happen."

**"We need robust data pipelines"**
→ "Domo is excellent for that. It's a data platform for data teams. Scoop is for business users who need answers now, not dashboards later."

**"Domo is more mature"**
→ "For dashboard building, absolutely. But business users don't want to build dashboards - they want to investigate problems. Different tools for different needs."

## Competitive Landmines
- Don't deny their data pipeline strengths
- Acknowledge AI Chat can query data
- Focus on portal prison and workflow gaps
- Emphasize cost difference

## The Portal Prison Demo
**Most Effective Demonstration**:
1. "Let me show you Domo insights in Excel" → Can't do it
2. "Let me show you Domo in Slack" → Can't do it
3. "Now watch Scoop" → =SCOOP("why did sales drop?")

## Updated Positioning (from Deep Dive)
- **Critical Gap**: Insights trapped in portal, can't integrate with business workflow
- **Secondary Gaps**: Cost (37x), setup complexity, dashboard-centric
- **Their Market**: Data teams building dashboards
- **Our Market**: Business users investigating problems

## The Closing Line
"Domo builds beautiful dashboards for $134,000 a year. Scoop answers business questions for $3,588. Which problem do you need solved?"
