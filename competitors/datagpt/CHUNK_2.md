# CHUNK 2: Technical Reality & Competitive Context (30-35 minutes)

## YOUR MISSION
Document technical limitations with quantified data and position in competitive landscape.

## PHASE 2A: Technical Performance Analysis (12-15 minutes)

### Performance Quantification
1. "DataGPT slow performance response time seconds query"
2. "DataGPT memory requirements GB RAM crashes"
3. "DataGPT concurrent users limit scalability testing"
4. "DataGPT database timeout connection errors"
5. "DataGPT uptime downtime SLA breach outage"

**Goal**: Get specific numbers - response times, memory needs, user limits, uptime stats

### Integration Reality Check
6. "DataGPT API rate limits throttling developers"
7. "DataGPT SSO integration broken SAML authentication"
8. "DataGPT mobile app terrible performance user"
9. "DataGPT embedding iframe security CSP issues"
10. "DataGPT REST API documentation incomplete missing"

**Focus**: Real developer pain points, integration failures, technical debt

## PHASE 2B: Competitive Positioning Research (10-12 minutes)

### Direct Competitive Intelligence
11. "DataGPT vs Tableau why customers switch"
12. "DataGPT vs ThoughtSpot RFP evaluation lost deal"
13. "DataGPT vs Qlik comparison customers choose alternative"
14. "DataGPT losing market share declining adoption 2024 2025"

### Analyst & Market Intelligence
15. "DataGPT Gartner customers complain disappointed"
16. "DataGPT Forrester critical assessment limitations"
17. "DataGPT analyst report customer feedback negative"

**Goal**: Position in market context, understand competitive losses

## PHASE 2C: Economic Impact Deep Dive (8-10 minutes)

### Total Cost of Ownership Reality
18. "DataGPT hidden costs professional services implementation"
19. "DataGPT training required weeks months learning curve"
20. "DataGPT consultant fees implementation partner expensive"
21. "DataGPT maintenance overhead admin full-time required"

### ROI and Value Realization
22. "DataGPT time to value months delayed insights"
23. "DataGPT ROI negative failed to deliver business value"
24. "DataGPT opportunity cost manual reporting workarounds"

**Focus**: True costs beyond licenses, delayed value realization
