# DataGPT Existing Research Inventory
**Date**: September 26, 2025
**Phase 0 Completion**

## Files Found
- ✅ README.md exists - Contains basic competitive overview
- ✅ BATTLE_CARD.md exists - Contains sales positioning
- ✅ RESEARCH_CHECKLIST.md exists - Research template ready
- ✅ research/ folder created
- ✅ evidence/ folder created
- ❌ No archive files found for DataGPT

## Existing Knowledge from README.md
### Key Findings Already Documented
1. **BUPAF Score**: 18/50 (Category D - Marketing Mirage)
2. **Fatal Flaw**: Rigid schema - "rare to adjust after setup" (from their own docs)
3. **Single Source Prison**: Can only query one data source at a time
4. **No Investigation**: Shows metrics only, can't find WHY things happened
5. **Portal Lock**: No Excel/Slack/PowerPoint integration
6. **Cost**: $60,000+/year (17x more than Scoop at $3,588)

### Technical Limitations Already Known
- Schema locked after configuration
- No multi-source analysis capability
- No root cause investigation (single query only)
- Limited to structured data only
- No workflow integration (portal-only)
- "Lightning Cache" is just standard caching marketed as innovation

## What We Still Need to Research
1. **Customer Horror Stories**: Implementation failures, switching decisions
2. **Performance Issues**: Query times, scalability limits, crashes
3. **Industry Limitations**: Vertical-specific problems, compliance gaps
4. **Competitive Losses**: Why customers choose alternatives
5. **Hidden Costs**: Implementation, training, maintenance
6. **Technical Reality**: API limits, integration failures
7. **Quantified Evidence**: Specific metrics, timelines, percentages

## Phase 0 Checklist
- ✅ Checked archive for DataGPT files (none found)
- ✅ Listed all existing files in competitors/datagpt/
- ✅ Read existing README.md
- ✅ Read existing BATTLE_CARD.md
- ✅ Created research/ and evidence/ folders
- ✅ Documented what was recovered

## Starting Point for New Research
We have good basic positioning but need:
- Real customer complaints and implementation stories
- Quantified performance and technical limitations
- Industry-specific evidence
- Competitive context and market positioning
- True total cost of ownership evidence
