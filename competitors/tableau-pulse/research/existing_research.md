## Key Findings from Existing Research
1. **Known Limitations**:
   - Schema changes break metrics completely (any column addition/change)
   - Limited to basic KPI monitoring only
   - Requires IT for all setup and changes
   - "NOT using LLMs" per their documentation
   - Template-based text generation vs true AI

2. **Competitive Positioning**:
   - BUPAF Score: 9/40 (very low business user empowerment)
   - Critical weakness: No schema evolution capability
   - Setup complexity: Weeks vs Scoop's 30 seconds
   - Cost: $165,000+ year one for 200 users vs Scoop $299/month

3. **Customer Pain Points Documented**:
   - Fortune 500 retailer replaced after 6 months
   - 3 days IT work required for each schema change
   - 400 IT hours saved by switching to Scoop

## Critical Gaps to Fill
- No real customer quotes from review sites
- No implementation horror stories with specifics
- No industry-specific limitations documented
- No Reddit/community feedback captured
- No consultant perspectives on failed implementations
- Missing G2/Capterra/TrustRadius negative reviews
- No evidence of metric proliferation issues
- No specific error messages or technical problems
