## The Bottom Line
**"They send alerts about metrics. We discover why things changed."**

## Critical Differentiators

### 1. Schema Evolution (Scoop's Killer Feature)
- **Scoop**: Add columns, change types, rename fields - everything works automatically
- **Tableau**: ANY schema change breaks everything, requires IT to rebuild
- **Demo This**: Add a column to your data in Scoop vs Tableau

### 2. Setup Time
- **Scoop**: 30 seconds (connect and ask)
- **Tableau**: Weeks (data sources, metrics, permissions)
- **Show This**: Live connection demo

### 3. True AI vs Template Matching
- **Scoop**: Multi-pass investigation with ML models
- **Tableau**: Pre-computed patterns with text templates
- **Evidence**: They admit "NOT using LLMs" in their docs

### 4. Business User Independence
- **Scoop**: Upload CSV, analyze immediately
- **Tableau**: Need IT for everything
- **Test**: "Can I analyze this spreadsheet right now?"

### 5. Total Cost
- **Scoop**: $299/month for entire team
- **Tableau**: $165,000+ year one for 200 users
- **ROI**: 95% cost reduction

## Discovery Questions

### Pain Point Questions
1. "How long did your Tableau Pulse implementation take?"
2. "What happens when you need to add a new data column?"
3. "Can your sales team upload their own spreadsheets?"
4. "How many people manage your Tableau environment?"
5. "Can Pulse tell you WHY metrics changed, not just that they did?"

### Red Flags to Listen For
- "IT handles the data setup" → No independence
- "We're still implementing" → Complex setup
- "We get alerts about changes" → No investigation
- "We use dashboards for analysis" → Pulse isn't enough
- "Waiting for data team" → Business users blocked

## Objection Handlers

### "We already have Tableau"
**Response**: "Perfect - Scoop complements Tableau beautifully. Your analysts keep building dashboards while business users get immediate answers. Plus, Scoop handles all those ad-hoc questions that don't justify a dashboard."

### "Tableau is industry standard"
**Response**: "Tableau is great for what it was built for - dashboards and visualizations. But Pulse proves they know that's not enough. The difference is we built for investigation from day one, while they're trying to bolt it on."

### "Salesforce is more stable"
**Response**: "Absolutely - and they're so stable they can't innovate. Notice Pulse can't handle schema changes? That's because they're locked into 20-year-old architecture. We built fresh for how data actually works today."

### "We need enterprise features"
**Response**: "Like what specifically? SSO? We have it. Data governance? Built in. The difference is we also have schema evolution, which Tableau will never have because it would break their entire model."

## Winning Talk Tracks

### For Business Users
"Imagine uploading a spreadsheet and getting answers in 30 seconds, not 30 days. That's the difference between Scoop and Tableau Pulse."

### For IT Leaders  
"Your team spends 60% of their time on schema changes and metric updates. Scoop handles that automatically, freeing IT for strategic work."

### For Executives
"Tableau Pulse tells you revenue dropped 15%. Scoop tells you it's because Northeast enterprise deals are stalling at contract review due to new procurement policies. Which would you rather know?"

### For Champions
"You'll be the hero who gave everyone data superpowers. While others wait weeks for IT, your team gets answers during the meeting."

## Proof Points to Show

1. **Schema Evolution Demo**
   - Add column in Scoop: Works instantly
   - Add column in Tableau: Everything breaks

2. **Investigation Demo**
   - Ask "Why did sales drop?"
   - Scoop: 5-step investigation with root cause
   - Tableau: "Sales decreased 15%" (that's it)

3. **Excel Integration**
   - Type =SCOOP("analyze sales by region")
   - Works in existing spreadsheet
   - Tableau: Export only, new interface

4. **Setup Speed**
   - Connect database: 10 seconds
   - Ask question: 20 seconds
   - Tableau: Show their setup guide (47 steps)

## Competitive Landmines

### What Not to Say
- Don't criticize Salesforce's size (they'll use it as stability)
- Don't call Pulse "useless" (it does basic alerts well)
- Don't promise features we don't have

### What to Emphasize
- Schema evolution (they literally cannot do this)
- Investigation depth (multi-pass vs single metric)
- True self-service (no IT required)
- Excel native (vs forcing new tools)

## Customer Success Story
"A Fortune 500 retailer replaced Tableau Pulse after 6 months. Why? Their merchandise team needed to add new product attributes weekly. Each change required 3 days of IT work in Tableau. With Scoop, they just add columns and keep analyzing. They've saved 400 IT hours in 3 months."

## The Closing Question
"Would you rather have a system that tells you what happened, or one that figures out why and what to do about it?"

**Remember**: Tableau Pulse is just alerts. Scoop is investigation. They monitor. We discover.
