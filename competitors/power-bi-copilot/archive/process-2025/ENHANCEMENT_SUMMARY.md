3. **Department Focus** - Specific pain/solution per role
4. **Embeddable Analytics** - Unique differentiator

### Framework Insights:
1. **150K is minimum** - Could easily go to 200K
2. **40 capabilities is achievable** - Just needs thoroughness
3. **Balance improved** - 65/35 better than 80/20
4. **Structure works** - 5-field approach is solid

## Recommendation

The current 105K version is already significantly better than the original. To complete:

1. Add remaining 45K of content (feasible)
2. Focus on listing concrete details (functions, sources)
3. Include more customer success stories
4. Add migration/coexistence guidance

The framework successfully guided creation of much more comprehensive and balanced content. The template should be updated to reflect that 150-200K characters is acceptable and beneficial.
