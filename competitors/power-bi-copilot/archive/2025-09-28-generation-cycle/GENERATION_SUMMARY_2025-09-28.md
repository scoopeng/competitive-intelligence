## Template Features Implemented (v2.1)

### 1. Question Hierarchy Section ✅
**Location**: Section 2.1 Investigation & Analysis

**Content**:
```
Simple "What" Questions (both handle):
- "Show me revenue by region"
- Power BI ✅ Works if in semantic model | Scoop ✅

Complex "What" Questions (analytical filtering):
- "Show opportunities from top 5 reps by win rate"
- Power BI ❌ Requires IT DAX (1-2 weeks) | Scoop ✅ (automatic)

"Why" Questions (investigation):
- "Why did churn increase?"
- Power BI ❌ "Can't answer questions that require generating new insights" | Scoop ✅
```

**Key Insight Line**:
> "Power BI Copilot is a text-to-query interface—handles simple questions but cannot generate complex analytical logic on the fly or investigate beyond single queries. Scoop is an AI data analyst—handles all three question types."

### 2. Semantic Model Boundary Block ✅
**Location**: Section 2.1, after Question Hierarchy

**Content**:
- Explains business users can only query what IT included in semantic model
- 4 concrete examples requiring IT work (Top N, thresholds, multi-condition, time comparison)
- Time contrast: 3 seconds (Scoop) vs 1-2 weeks (Power BI IT work)

**Quote**:
> "If IT didn't include a table or relationship, business users cannot analyze it—even if data exists in source systems."

### 3. At-a-Glance Table Enhancement ✅
**Location**: Section 1 Executive Comparison

**New Rows Added**:
```
| **Question Capabilities** |
| Simple "What" Questions | ✅ Works if in semantic model | ✅ All questions | Works on any data vs IT-built models |
| Complex "What" (Analytical Filtering) | ❌ Requires IT DAX measures (1-2 weeks) | ✅ Automatic subqueries | 3 seconds vs 1-2 weeks |
| "Why" Investigation | ❌ Single query only, no follow-ups | ✅ Multi-pass analysis | Investigation vs text-to-query |
```

**Visual Pattern**: ❌❌❌ vs ✅✅✅ immediately visible

### 4. FAQ Question About Complex Queries ✅
**Location**: Section 6 FAQ, Capabilities subsection

**Content**:
> **Q: Can Power BI Copilot handle complex analytical questions like "show top performers by calculated metric"?**
> A: No. Questions like "show opportunities from top 5 sales reps by win rate" require subqueries (calculate win rate, rank reps, filter opportunities). In Power BI Copilot, IT must build custom DAX measures (1-2 weeks) before business users can ask this type of question. Scoop handles these automatically via subquery generation—no pre-work needed.

## Strategic Positioning Applied

### Primary Message (Investigation-First)
**Throughout document**:
- Lead with "AI data analyst vs text-to-query interface"
- Power BI: 70% for analysts building dashboards, 30% for business users
- Three limitations consistently emphasized:
  1. Cannot investigate "why"
  2. Cannot handle complex "what"
  3. Semantic model boundary

### Evidence Integration
**All key quotes cited**:
- ✅ "Copilot doesn't answer follow-up questions. One question at a time" (Microsoft)
- ✅ "Can't currently answer questions that require generating new insights" (Microsoft)
- ✅ "Nondeterministic, so it's not guaranteed to produce the same answer" (Microsoft)
- ✅ 3% satisfaction, 53% error rate (Gartner 2025)
- ✅ $67K F64 capacity requirement
- ✅ 14+ weeks implementation timeline

### Scenarios Included
**From strategy document**:
1. ✅ Investigation That Can't Continue (primary scenario, "why" questions)
2. ✅ Complex Question That Requires IT (new, subquery example)
3. ✅ $67K Question That Fails (cost + nondeterminism)
4. ✅ 14 Weeks to Hello World (time-to-value)
5. ✅ Excel Copilot Upsell (hidden costs)

## Positioning Consistency

### "AI Data Analyst" Framing
Used consistently throughout:
- TL;DR: "Scoop is an AI data analyst you chat with"
- Bottom Line: "AI data analyst designed for business user investigation"
- Key Insight: "Scoop is an AI data analyst—handles all three question types"
- FAQ: "AI data analyst you interact with through chat"

### "Text-to-Query Interface" Framing
Applied to Power BI throughout:
- Bottom Line: "Text-to-query interface primarily designed for analysts"
- Key Insight: "Power BI Copilot is a text-to-query interface"
- Section headers: "Text-to-query for IT-built models"

### 70/30 Split
Mentioned strategically:
- Bottom Line: "70% of Microsoft's positioning" for analysts
- Positioning: "Limited business user functionality (30%)"
- Context: Power BI is primarily for report creators, secondarily for business users
