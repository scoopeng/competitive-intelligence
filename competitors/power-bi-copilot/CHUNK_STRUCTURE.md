# Chunk Structure - Aligned with 6 Phases

## CHUNK 1: Discovery & Evidence Gathering
**Covers**: Phases 1, 2, 3 (Recovery, URL Verification, Customer Evidence)
**Time**: 20-30 minutes
**Focus**: Find everything that exists about this competitor

### What it does:
- Check archives for existing research (Phase 1)
- Verify URLs and documentation (Phase 2)
- Mine review sites and forums (Phase 3)
- Gather all customer complaints
- Document all sources

### Output:
- `research/evidence.md` with all findings
- `evidence/sources.md` with verified URLs

## CHUNK 2: Technical & Pricing Deep Dive
**Covers**: Phases 4, 5 (Technical Research, Pricing Investigation)
**Time**: 15-20 minutes
**Focus**: Understand technical limitations and true costs

### What it does:
- Analyze architecture limitations (Phase 4)
- Find performance issues
- Document integration problems
- Investigate full pricing model (Phase 5)
- Find hidden costs
- Calculate TCO at different scales

### Output:
- `research/technical_analysis.md`
- `research/pricing_analysis.md`

## CHUNK 3: Analysis & Sales Enablement
**Covers**: Phase 6 + Output Generation
**Time**: 10-15 minutes
**Focus**: Transform research into sales weapons

### What it does:
- Score BUPAF dimensions (Phase 6)
- Create fatal flaws list
- Update battle card
- Generate sales materials
- Create email templates
- Build comparison tables

### Output:
- Updated `BATTLE_CARD.md`
- `outputs/sales_materials.md`
- `outputs/email_templates.md`
- BUPAF scoring with evidence

## Why This Structure Works

1. **Chunk 1** = Broad discovery (cast wide net)
2. **Chunk 2** = Deep technical dive (get specific)
3. **Chunk 3** = Sales transformation (make it usable)

Each chunk:
- Has clear inputs/outputs
- Maintains its own context
- Builds on previous work
- Can be run independently if needed

## Alternative: 2-Chunk Approach

### MEGA CHUNK 1: All Research (Phases 1-5)
- Everything about finding and gathering
- 30-40 minutes
- One comprehensive evidence file

### MEGA CHUNK 2: All Analysis (Phase 6 + Outputs)
- Everything about analyzing and packaging
- 15-20 minutes
- All deliverables

## Recommendation

Use 3-chunk approach for:
- Better error recovery
- Clearer progress tracking
- Logical separation of concerns
- Manageable execution times

The 3 chunks map perfectly to:
1. DISCOVER (what exists)
2. UNDERSTAND (what it means)
3. WEAPONIZE (how to use it)
