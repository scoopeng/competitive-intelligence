## 1. CRITICAL PROBLEMS & LIMITATIONS

### Nondeterministic Behavior (Microsoft Admission)
**Finding**: Power BI Copilot produces different results for the same question
**Evidence**: "Power BI Copilot's underlying model is nondeterministic and isn't guaranteed to produce a correct answer, or the same answer with the same prompt, model, and data"
**Source**: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/copilot-semantic-models
**Impact**: Cannot trust results for business decisions when the same question gives different answers

### Misleading Outputs (Microsoft Warning)
**Finding**: Microsoft officially warns about incorrect and misleading data
**Evidence**: "Without proper data preparation, Copilot can struggle to interpret data correctly - leading to generic, inaccurate, or even misleading outputs"
**Source**: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/copilot-introduction
**Impact**: Business decisions based on misleading data can be catastrophic

### Data Preparation Burden
**Finding**: Extensive preparation required before Copilot works
**Evidence**: "Model owners need to invest in prepping their data for AI to ensure Copilot understands the unique business context"
**Source**: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/copilot-prepare-data-ai
**Impact**: 14+ weeks of data prep typical before getting value

### Geographic Restrictions
**Finding**: Not available in many regions including major business hubs
**Evidence**: "Not supported in sovereign clouds... Unavailable in specific regions like India West, Indonesia Central, Korea South"
**Source**: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/copilot-introduction
**Impact**: Global organizations cannot use consistently across offices

### Version Compatibility Issues
**Finding**: Desktop versions constantly breaking compatibility
**Evidence**: "The report view Copilot pane isn't supported in Power BI Desktop versions dated January 2025 and earlier"
**Source**: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/copilot-power-bi-desktop
**Impact**: Forced updates disrupting workflow

### Capacity Propagation Delays
**Finding**: Paying for capacity doesn't immediately enable features
**Evidence**: "Newly purchased capacity may take up to 24 hours for Copilot recognition"
**Source**: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/copilot-introduction
**Impact**: Organizations pay but can't use features immediately

### Filter Application Limitations
**Finding**: Cannot apply filters properly in responses
**Evidence**: "Previously, responses could only reflect what was currently visible on the report page, without the ability to apply any additional existing filters"
**Source**: Power BI August 2025 Feature Summary
**Impact**: Cannot answer basic questions like 'What were sales in 2024?'

### DAX Generation Problems
**Finding**: Generated code contains errors and inconsistencies
**Evidence**: "While the suggested code might work in the initial DAX query, in a different filter context of your report, it could produce unexpected or incorrect results"
**Source**: https://blog.crossjoin.co.uk/2025/07/06/power-bi-copilot-ai-instructions
**Impact**: Generated code breaks in production

### EU Data Boundary Violations (March 2024)
**Finding**: Bug caused EU customer data to leave EU boundaries
**Evidence**: "If you are using a Premium or Fabric capacity in the EU, you no longer need to enable the cross geo tenant switch"
**Source**: https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/copilot-updates-march-2024/
**Impact**: Regulatory compliance violations

### Forced Default Enablement (September 2025)
**Finding**: Microsoft forcing Copilot on by default regardless of readiness
**Evidence**: "Starting September 5, 2025, 'Standalone Copilot will be enabled by default' for eligible tenants"
**Source**: https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/the-standalone-copilot-in-power-bi-will-be-turned-on-by-default-in-september/
**Impact**: Organizations forced into AI processing without consent

## 2. PRICING & LICENSING ISSUES

### Actual Costs
- F64 Fabric Capacity: $60,000+/year minimum
- P1 Premium Capacity: Similar pricing tier
- Not available on trials or PPU ($20/user)
- Token consumption: 400 CU/1000 input tokens, 1200 CU/1000 output tokens
**Source**: https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-fabric-copilot-pricing-2/

### Licensing Confusion
**Finding**: Premium Per User (PPU) doesn't include Copilot despite name
**Customer Quote**: "Users have expressed concern about having to purchase this capacity license at this steep cost"
**Source**: https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Service/Copilot-in-Power-BI-Service-with-Premium-per-User-is-not-working/m-p/3744846

### Hidden Consumption Costs
**Finding**: Copilot silently consumes capacity affecting other operations
**Evidence**: "Copilot consumes significant capacity and if you use too much, this can lead to throttling your other operations, including causing slow queries and reports"
**Source**: https://www.2-data.com/knowledge-hub/licensing-cost-usage-microsoft-copilot-power-bi

### Real Usage Example
**Finding**: Even minimal testing consumes significant capacity
**Evidence**: "For the tests in this article, I used 3% of my total F64 capacity that's available in a 24h period"
