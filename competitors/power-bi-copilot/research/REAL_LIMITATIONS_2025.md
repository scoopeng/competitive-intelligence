# Power BI Copilot - Real Limitations (2025)

**Research Date**: September 24, 2025
**Method**: Web search and documentation review

## Critical Limitations with Evidence

### 1. Non-Deterministic Results ⚠️
- **Issue**: Different results with same prompts
- **Evidence**: Users report getting varying outputs, including incorrect data periods
- **Impact**: Cannot rely on consistent answers for business decisions

### 2. Data Preparation Burden
- **Issue**: Requires extensive data modeling before Copilot works
- **Evidence**: Model owners must heavily prep data for AI understanding
- **Impact**: High setup cost and time investment

### 3. Limited Functionality vs Competitors
- **Issue**: Provides instructions rather than executing tasks
- **Evidence**: Unlike ChatGPT, struggles with basic operations
- **Impact**: Users disappointed with actual capabilities

### 4. Platform Restrictions
- **Windows-only desktop app**
- **No sovereign cloud support** (GPU limitations)
- **Premium licensing required** ($$$)

### 5. Technical Complexity
- **DAX requirement** for advanced features
- **Poor NoSQL/API support**
- **Workspace confusion** for billing

### 6. Search & Discovery Risks
- May find ill-maintained reports
- Can provide misleading information from bad sources
- Risk of using purpose-built reports incorrectly
