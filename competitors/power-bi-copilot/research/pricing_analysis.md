## Hidden Costs Discovered

### 1. Data Refresh Charges
- Premium supports 48 refreshes/day
- Real-time data needs incur additional charges
- Exceeding limits results in unexpected bills

### 2. Integration Costs
- Microsoft service integrations may require additional licenses
- Third-party connectors often need separate subscriptions
- API throttling forces capacity upgrades

### 3. Training & Support
- Not included in base pricing
- Microsoft support plans extra
- Extensive training required for DAX/data modeling

### 4. Migration from P-SKUs
- **Forced Migration**: P-SKUs retiring after Feb 1, 2025
- Must transition to more expensive F-SKUs
- No grandfather pricing - immediate cost increase

### 5. Capacity Unit Overages
- CU consumption easily exceeds limits
- Copilot uses 3% of F64 in 24-hour test period
- Throttling forces capacity upgrades

### 6. Storage Overages
- 64TB included seems generous but:
  - Includes all workspace data
  - Soft-deleted data counts
  - Historical versions retained
- Additional storage expensive

## Key Findings

1. **40% Price Shock**: Power BI Pro increased 40% in April 2025
2. **Capacity Tax**: Minimum $67,392/year just for Copilot capability
3. **Hidden Costs**: Integration, training, support, overages add 20-30%
4. **Forced Migration**: P-SKU retirement forces expensive upgrades
5. **No Mid-Market Option**: Jump from $24/user to $5,616/month capacity

## Customer Complaints (2025)

- "Inundated with calls from clients concerned about 10X price increases"
- "The price hike is a blow for smaller businesses"
- "Billing shock at renewal time"
- "Strategic push to force E5 adoption"

## Conclusion

Power BI Copilot's true cost for 200 users exceeds $100,000/year - not including hidden costs, training, or infrastructure management. The April 2025 price increases (40% for Pro) combined with mandatory F64 capacity makes it prohibitively expensive for mid-market organizations. Scoop Analytics offers comparable AI capabilities at a fraction of the infrastructure cost, with transparent pricing and no capacity requirements.
