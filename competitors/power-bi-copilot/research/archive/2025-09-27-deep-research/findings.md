#### 5. TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS
**Problem**: Multiple technical constraints limit usability
- DirectQuery and Composite models have limitations
- DirectLake not supported at all
- Works best only with Import mode
- Cannot edit visuals directly after generation
- Summary visual must be manually refreshed after data updates
- Cross-highlighting doesn't work with summaries
- Visual doesn't work properly in Power BI Desktop (must use Service)
- Browser compatibility issues
- **Source**: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/copilot-power-bi-desktop

#### 6. COMMON ERROR MESSAGES AND FAILURES
**Problem**: Frequent errors with unclear resolution paths
- "Copilot isn't available in this Report" error for PPU users
- "Something went wrong and we couldn't load the narrative" error
- Grayed out Copilot button despite meeting requirements
- Tenant configuration issues cause failures
- Admin settings changes can break functionality

#### 7. GPU AND PERFORMANCE ISSUES
**Problem**: Infrastructure limitations cause throttling
- Limited GPU capacity causes throttling
- Excessive requests result in partial model processing
- Performance degrades with complex models
- Caching means identical prompts return same (potentially wrong) results for 24 hours
- **Source**: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/copilot-introduction

#### 8. FORCED ROLLOUT CONCERNS
**Problem**: Automatic enablement without organizational readiness
- Starting September 1, 2025, Copilot will be enabled by default for all tenants
- Organizations must opt out if not ready
- No consideration for data governance concerns
- Privacy and security implications for automatic AI processing

### Search Query Used
"Power BI Copilot accuracy problems wrong data hallucination issues 2024"

### Key Findings

#### 9. NONDETERMINISTIC AND INCONSISTENT OUTPUTS
**Problem**: Copilot produces different results for identical inputs
- Same prompts repeated a week later yield completely different results
- Sometimes correct, sometimes showing wrong data (e.g., "August 2024" when not requested)
- Suggests currency options ('USD', 'EUR', 'GBP') that don't exist in the model
- Non-deterministic behavior makes reliability impossible to assess
- Users can't determine if variations are due to Microsoft changes or inherent instability
- **Source**: https://data-goblins.com/power-bi/copilot-in-power-bi

#### 10. FALSE DATA AVAILABILITY CLAIMS
**Problem**: Copilot incorrectly reports on data presence
- Claims "no data for 2024" when data actually exists in model
- Incorrectly filters using Birthday column from Customer table instead of designated date table
- Fundamental misunderstanding of data model structure
- **Source**: https://data-goblins.com/power-bi/copilot-in-power-bi

#### 11. INDUSTRY-WIDE HALLUCINATION RATES
**Problem**: General AI hallucination statistics apply to Power BI Copilot
- Studies show 3% to 10% hallucination rate across all generative AI responses
- Rate depends on model and task complexity
- Leads to misunderstandings, errors, user dissatisfaction
- Creates reputational risks and compliance issues in regulated industries
- **Source**: https://shelf.io/blog/how-to-prevent-microsoft-copilot-hallucinations/

#### 12. NO CONFIDENCE INDICATORS
**Problem**: Users cannot assess output reliability
- No indication of certainty or trustworthiness in outputs
- Every Copilot window warns "AI can make mistakes"
- No way to distinguish reliable from unreliable responses
- Users must verify everything manually
