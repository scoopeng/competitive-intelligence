# Archive: Deep Research - September 27, 2025

## Why These Files Were Archived

All findings from these documents have been consolidated into:
**`AI_DATA_ANALYST_VS_TEXT_TO_QUERY.md`**

This archive preserves the research journey and intermediate analysis.

## Files in This Archive

### Today's Deep Research (Sep 27, 2025)

**Intermediate Consolidations**:
- `COMPREHENSIVE_LIMITATIONS_ANALYSIS.md` (44K) - Layer 1 limitations consolidation (DAX dependency, single-turn, nondeterminism)
- `end_user_capabilities_research.md` (13K) - Initial finding: Power BI Copilot is primarily for report creators, not business users
- `query_richness_analysis.md` (30K) - Deep analysis comparing Scoop's Query JSON capabilities to Power BI semantic models

**Key Findings Preserved in Final Document**:
- Semantic model as prison (business users bounded by IT's definitions)
- Single-turn constraint ("one question at a time" - Microsoft's words)
- Subquery patterns (top N by calculated metric, aggregation thresholds)
- On-the-fly calculations (150+ Excel functions vs pre-built DAX)
- Nondeterminism problem (same Q → different A)
- Report creator vs business user distinction
- 6-12 week setup barrier

### Previous Research (Sep 25, 2025)

**Earlier Analysis**:
- `REAL_LIMITATIONS_2025.md` - Initial limitations research
- `evidence.md` - Source URL documentation
- `findings.md` - Early capability findings
- `technical_analysis.md` - Technical constraint analysis
- `pricing_analysis.md` - Cost breakdown
- `bupaf_scoring.md` - BUA framework scoring
- Various research notes and logs

**Status**: All superseded by comprehensive consolidation

## The Research Journey

**Phase 1** (Sep 25): Initial research on Power BI Copilot capabilities
- Focused on pricing, technical constraints, basic limitations
- Created multiple small documents

**Phase 2** (Sep 27 morning): Deep dive into end-user capabilities
- Discovery: Power BI Copilot is primarily for report creators (analysts)
- Business users have limited capabilities within semantic model boundaries

**Phase 3** (Sep 27 afternoon): Query richness analysis
- Analyzed Scoop's Query JSON structure (150+ Excel functions, subqueries, statistical functions)
- Compared to Power BI's semantic model + DAX approach
- Identified setup time barrier (6-12 weeks)

**Phase 4** (Sep 27 evening): Comprehensive consolidation
- Created Layer 1 analysis (core query/viz flexibility)
- Consolidated all findings
- Applied "AI Data Analyst vs Text-to-Query Tool" framing
- Final document: 39K, 10 parts, ready for competitive strategy

## Final Deliverable

**`AI_DATA_ANALYST_VS_TEXT_TO_QUERY.md`**
- Single consolidated document (no sprawl)
- Clear positioning framework: "Scoop is your AI data analyst"
- Three-level hierarchy: Reporting → Text-to-Query → AI Data Analyst
- Question capability breakdown: Simple "what", Complex "what", "Why"
- Ready to integrate into COMPETITIVE_STRATEGY.md

## Preservation Rationale

These files are preserved because:
1. **Show research process** - how we arrived at conclusions
2. **Contain detailed evidence** - specific Microsoft docs quotes, technical details
3. **May be useful for deep dives** - if someone needs to verify specific claims
4. **Audit trail** - demonstrates thorough research methodology
