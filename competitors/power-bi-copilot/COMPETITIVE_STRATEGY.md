## 1. PRIMARY WEAKNESSES (Rank Top 3)

**#1: Infrastructure Tax & IT Dependency** (Severity: Critical)
- **Evidence**: BUA Setup 2/8, requires F64 capacity ($67K/year mandatory), 14+ weeks implementation, semantic model required before ANY queries work
- **Why It Matters**: $67K/year infrastructure tax before you can ask a single question. IT must build semantic models, maintain F64 capacity, troubleshoot issues. Business users completely blocked until IT finishes extensive setup. Total Year 1 cost: $101K minimum for 200 users, often $233K-$293K with full implementation.
- **Our Advantage**: Scoop has zero infrastructure requirements. 30-second setup. No capacity fees. No semantic modeling. Business users start immediately. Comparable annual pricing but $0 implementation cost.
- **Emphasis Level**: 20% of web comparison

**#2: Nondeterministic Behavior & Low Satisfaction** (Severity: High)
- **Evidence**: Microsoft's own warning: "nondeterministic, so it's not guaranteed to produce the same answer with the same prompt" + Gartner 2025: Only 3% of IT leaders find significant value, 53% cite "too many inaccurate results"
- **Why It Matters**: Same question = different answers each time. Cannot trust for business decisions. 53% error rate per Gartner. Microsoft warns outputs can be "misleading." This is NOT a features gap—it's a fundamental reliability problem. However, LLM models may improve over time, reducing (but not eliminating) inconsistency.
- **Our Advantage**: Scoop is deterministic (same question = same answer always). ML confidence scoring. Transparent results. Built for decision-making, not experimentation.
- **Emphasis Level**: 15% of web comparison

**#3: Bounded by Semantic Models & Cannot Investigate** (Severity: Critical)
- **Evidence**: BUA Investigation effectively 0, "Copilot doesn't answer follow-up questions. One question at a time" + "Can't currently answer questions that require generating new insights" (Microsoft docs) + Semantic model boundary (business users can only query what IT pre-built)
- **Why It Matters - Three Fundamental Limitations**:
  1. **Cannot investigate "why"**: Can only answer "what happened" questions. Cannot do multi-step analysis, test hypotheses, or discover root causes. Microsoft explicitly: "Can't answer questions that require generating new insights."
  2. **Cannot handle complex "what"**: Simple questions like "show revenue by region" work. Complex analytical questions like "show opportunities from top 5 reps by win rate" or "show accounts where LTV > $100K and growth > 20%" require subqueries (calculate metric, rank/filter, then show results). Power BI needs IT to build custom DAX measures (1-2 weeks per pattern). Examples: Top N by calculated metric, aggregation thresholds, multiple calculated conditions, time comparisons with filtering—all blocked without pre-built DAX.
  3. **Semantic model prison**: Business users can only query tables, relationships, and metrics IT included in semantic model. Cannot explore beyond boundaries IT defined. If IT didn't relate Customers to Support Tickets, users cannot analyze churn by support volume—even if data exists in source systems.
- **Our Advantage**: Scoop's multi-pass investigation (3-10 automated queries for "why" questions), automatic subquery generation (handles any analytical filtering pattern), works on any data (no semantic model boundary). AI data analyst, not text-to-query interface.
- **Emphasis Level**: 30% of web comparison

---

## 2. KEY SCENARIOS (Stories that expose weaknesses)

**Scenario 1: The Investigation That Can't Continue**
- **When to Use**: When discussing investigation vs single-query (PRIMARY SCENARIO)
- **Story**: "Ask Power BI Copilot: 'Why did customer churn increase?' It gives you 'Churn increased 23%.' You ask: 'Why?' It doesn't remember previous context. Microsoft docs admit: 'Copilot doesn't answer follow-up questions.' Each query is isolated. Ask Scoop the same question—it automatically tests 8 hypotheses, identifies root cause (support escalation pattern), and provides intervention strategy. No follow-up needed."
- **Expected Impact**: Demonstrates Power BI is "text-to-query" not "AI analyst." Single queries feel like talking to a goldfish—no memory. Resonates with users who need actual analysis.

**Scenario 2: The Complex Question That Requires IT**
- **When to Use**: When discussing semantic model boundaries and IT dependency
- **Story**: "Sales VP asks Power BI Copilot: 'Show me deals from our top 5 reps by win rate this quarter.' Copilot returns all deals (didn't understand the complex filtering). VP clarifies: 'I need deals ONLY from the 5 reps with highest win rates.' Copilot can't do this—requires IT to build DAX: (1) Calculate win rate per rep, (2) Rank reps and identify top 5, (3) Filter deals to those reps only. IT workload: 1-2 weeks. Ask Scoop the same question—automatic subquery generation calculates win rate, ranks, filters in 3 seconds. Power BI is bounded by semantic model. Scoop works on raw data with analytical logic built in."
- **Expected Impact**: Shows "complex what" limitation concretely. Demonstrates semantic model boundary. Quick contrast (1-2 weeks vs 3 seconds).

**Scenario 3: The $67K Question That Fails**
- **When to Use**: When discussing cost and reliability together
- **Story**: "You pay $67K/year for F64 capacity so Power BI Copilot can work. You ask 'What caused Q3 revenue drop?' twice. You get two different answers because it's nondeterministic. Microsoft warns results can be 'misleading.' Which answer do you trust for your board presentation? With Scoop, you get the same answer every time with ML confidence scoring—and no $67K infrastructure tax."
- **Expected Impact**: Combines cost pain with reliability pain. Shows you're paying premium for unreliable results. Resonates with finance and executives who need trustworthy data.

**Scenario 4: 14 Weeks to "Hello World"**
- **When to Use**: When discussing time-to-value and IT dependency
- **Story**: "Business user wants to start analyzing customer data. Power BI path: Submit IT ticket → Wait for F64 provisioning (24 hours minimum) → Wait for semantic model creation (6-12 weeks) → Wait for testing (2 weeks) → THEN ask first question. Total: 14+ weeks, $40K-$80K implementation cost. Scoop path: Connect data (30 seconds) → Start asking questions. Total: 30 seconds, $0 implementation."
- **Expected Impact**: Time contrast is extreme (14 weeks vs 30 sec). Shows IT bottleneck problem. Resonates with business leaders tired of waiting.

**Scenario 5: Excel Copilot Upsell**
- **When to Use**: When discussing hidden costs and Excel integration
- **Story**: "Power BI Copilot has ZERO Excel formula support. Microsoft's solution? Buy separate Excel Copilot for $30/user/month (preview only, English only). So for 200 users who need Excel: $34K/year Power BI + $72K/year Excel Copilot = $106K/year for split functionality. Scoop has 150+ Excel formulas native—included, no upsell, production-ready."
- **Expected Impact**: Shows Microsoft's nickel-and-dime strategy. Business users need Excel integration, not an upsell. $72K/year extra for Excel support feels predatory.

## 3. TALKING POINTS (Emphasis hierarchy)

**Lead With** (Most important - first 1000 words):
1. **"Text-to-query vs AI data analyst"** (positioning) - *Because this frames the entire conversation*
2. **"Can't investigate why or handle complex what"** (investigation) - *Because this is the deepest, most defensible gap*
3. **"One question at a time, no follow-ups"** (single-turn) - *Because Microsoft admits this explicitly*
4. **"$67K infrastructure tax + 14-week setup"** (cost/time) - *Because it's a door-opener, but secondary to capability gap*

**Always Mention** (Standard Scoop advantages):
5. **Multi-pass investigation** (3-10 automated queries for "why" questions)
6. **Subquery generation** (top N, thresholds, complex filtering - automatic)
7. **Deterministic results** (same Q = same A, always)
8. **Excel formula engine** (150+ functions vs zero, no $30/user upsell)
9. **No semantic model required** (works on any data vs IT-built models)
10. **Slack integration** (vs Teams-only, no Slack)

**De-Emphasize** (Acknowledge but don't lead):
- **Nondeterminism** (mention but models may improve over time)
- **Microsoft ecosystem** (Power BI has strong MS integration)
- **Enterprise governance** (they have good RLS/governance features)

**De-Emphasize** (Minor mentions only):
- **Microsoft ecosystem** (Power BI has strong MS integration, don't pretend it doesn't)
- **Enterprise governance** (they have good RLS/governance features)
- **Teams integration** (similar to our Slack, not a huge differentiator)

## 4. CONTENT DISTRIBUTION (Word allocation for 7,500-word comparison)

**Recommended Mix**:
- **Section 1 (Executive Summary)**: 12% (~900 words)
- **Section 2 (Capabilities)**: 53% (~4,000 words)
  - **Investigation & Analytical Capability**: 30% (~2,250 words) ⬆️ MAJOR INCREASE
    - Multi-pass investigation: 750 words
    - Complex "what" questions (subqueries): 600 words
    - No follow-ups: 450 words
    - Root cause examples: 450 words
  - **Cost & Infrastructure Tax**: 20% (~1,500 words)
    - F64 capacity requirement: 500 words
    - Hidden costs breakdown: 400 words
    - Excel Copilot upsell: 300 words
    - TCO comparison: 300 words
  - **Reliability & Nondeterminism**: 15% (~1,125 words) ⬇️ REDUCED
    - Nondeterministic behavior: 450 words
    - Gartner 3% satisfaction: 300 words
    - Microsoft's own warnings: 225 words
    - Determinism comparison: 150 words
  - **Setup & IT Dependency**: 15% (~1,125 words)
  - **Excel Integration**: 12% (~900 words) (emphasize $30/user upsell angle)
  - **UI/Workflow**: 8% (~600 words) (They have Teams, not huge gap)
- **Section 3 (Use Cases)**: 15% (~1,125 words) (heavy on investigation scenarios)
- **Section 4 (FAQ/Evidence/Next Steps)**: 10% (~750 words)
- **Section 5 (Schema Evolution)**: 10% (~750 words) (universal BI weakness)

**Rationale**:
Power BI Copilot's biggest weakness is investigation limitation (30%)—cannot handle complex "what" questions (subqueries, analytical filtering) or "why" questions (multi-step analysis). This is architectural and harder for Microsoft to fix than nondeterminism (which may improve with better LLM models). Cost ($67K, 20%) is still a door-opener. Nondeterminism (15%) is real but may decrease as models improve. Focus: Investigation > Cost > Reliability.

**Comparison to Default**:
- ⬆️ Increased: Investigation (normally 15%, now 30%) - Deepest, most defensible gap (complex what + why + semantic model boundary)
- → Kept: Cost/Infrastructure (20%) - Still door-opener, but supporting not lead
- ⬇️ Decreased: Reliability (normally 20%, now 15%) - LLM models may improve over time
- → Kept: Setup/IT (15%) - Important for semantic model angle
- → Kept: Excel (12%) - $30/user upsell is good supporting point
- → Kept: UI/Workflow (8%) - Teams integration reduces this gap

## 6. WIN CONDITIONS (What makes us win)

**We Win When**:
1. **Cost sensitivity is high** - $67K/year F64 tax + $40-80K implementation is dealbreaker
2. **Excel users dominate** - They need formulas, not willing to pay extra $30/user/month for Excel Copilot
3. **Reliability matters for decisions** - Nondeterministic results are unacceptable for board presentations / strategic decisions
4. **Fast deployment needed** - Can't wait 14+ weeks for IT to build semantic models
5. **Investigation required** - Need to answer "why" questions, not just "what happened"
6. **Slack-based company** - No Slack integration for Power BI Copilot (Teams only)
7. **Schema changes frequently** - Semantic model maintenance burden is too high
8. **Multi-source analytics** - Need to query beyond Microsoft ecosystem

**We Lose When**:
- Company is 100% Microsoft shop with existing Power BI investment and dedicated BI team
- Already have F64 capacity for other Fabric features (marginal cost is lower)
- Teams is primary collaboration tool and Slack isn't used
- IT is comfortable maintaining semantic models and users accept 14-week timelines
- Nondeterminism is acceptable ("good enough" for exploratory analysis, not decisions)
- Budget for Microsoft 365 E5 bundle already includes Copilot features

**Neutral** (Could go either way):
- Large Power BI deployment but business users frustrated with access/speed
- Microsoft relationship is important but open to best-of-breed for analytics
- Some tolerance for nondeterminism if other factors compensate

## 7. COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

**One-Sentence Position**:
"Power BI Copilot is a text-to-query interface bounded by IT-built semantic models—handles simple 'what' questions only, cannot investigate 'why' or handle complex analytical filtering, requires $67K/year infrastructure and delivers nondeterministic results. Scoop is an AI data analyst—handles complex 'what' and 'why' questions through multi-pass investigation, works on any data, zero infrastructure, deterministic results."

**Elevator Pitch** (30 seconds):
"Power BI Copilot is two things: primarily, an AI assistant for analysts building dashboards (70% of Microsoft's positioning), and secondarily, a text-to-query interface for business users (30%). For business users, it can answer simple 'what' questions—'show revenue by region'—but cannot investigate 'why' questions or handle complex analytical filtering like 'show opportunities from top 5 reps by win rate.' Microsoft documentation explicitly states: 'Copilot doesn't answer follow-up questions. One question at a time' and 'Can't currently answer questions that require generating new insights.' Additionally, it requires $67K/year F64 capacity, 14+ weeks of semantic modeling, and delivers nondeterministic results (same question → different answers). Scoop is an AI data analyst built for investigation—multi-pass analysis, complex subquery generation, 'why' questions, deterministic results, zero infrastructure. Power BI Copilot shows you the data. Scoop investigates and explains."

**Key Contrast**:
| Dimension | Power BI Copilot | Scoop |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| **Product Type** | Text-to-query interface (for analysts 70%, business users 30%) | AI data analyst (for business users) |
| **Built For** | Power BI users (after IT setup) | Business users with Excel skills |
| **Simple "What" Questions** | ✅ Works (if in semantic model) | ✅ Works |
| **Complex "What" Questions** | ❌ Requires IT DAX (1-2 weeks per pattern) | ✅ Automatic subqueries |
| **"Why" Investigation** | ❌ Cannot investigate | ✅ Multi-pass (3-10 queries) |
| **Infrastructure Cost** | $67K/year (F64 capacity mandatory) | $0 (zero infrastructure) |
| **Setup Time** | 14+ weeks (semantic model + F64) | 30 seconds |
| **Reliability** | Nondeterministic (different answers) | Deterministic (same answer always) |
| **Excel Integration** | $30/user/month extra (Excel Copilot) | 150+ formulas included |
| **Collaboration** | Teams only | Slack + Teams + Email |

## 8. AVOID OVER-CLAIMING (Credibility guardrails)

**Don't Say** (Risks credibility):
- "Power BI Copilot never works" - *It works for some queries, just 53% error rate and nondeterministic*
- "Microsoft doesn't support it" - *Microsoft is investing heavily, just has fundamental limitations*
- "No one uses Power BI" - *Power BI is widely used, Copilot add-on has low adoption*
- "Teams integration is useless" - *Teams is widely used, it's just not universal (Slack companies miss out)*
- "Power BI has no value" - *Traditional Power BI has value, Copilot add-on has low satisfaction*

**Instead Say** (Evidence-based alternatives):
- "Nondeterministic behavior means same question produces different answers" - *Microsoft's own admission*
- "Only 3% of IT leaders find significant value" - *Gartner 2025, specific and devastating*
- "Requires $67K/year F64 capacity before you can ask a single question" - *Factual, documented pricing*
- "Cannot answer follow-up questions—one question at a time" - *Microsoft's own documentation*
- "53% cite too many inaccurate results" - *Gartner survey, evidence-based*
- "Requires separate $30/user/month Excel Copilot for formula support" - *Microsoft pricing, not included*

### Example 2: The Nondeterminism Problem

**Setup**: CFO needs to present Q3 financial variance analysis to board.

**Monday Morning - Power BI Copilot**:
```
CFO: "What caused Q3 revenue to drop below forecast?"

Power BI Copilot Response #1:
"Q3 revenue was $8.1M, down 12% from forecast. Main factor was
product mix shift toward lower-margin items."

CFO takes notes for board presentation.
```

**Monday Afternoon - Power BI Copilot** (Same Question):
```
CFO (wants to verify): "What caused Q3 revenue to drop below forecast?"

Power BI Copilot Response #2:
"Q3 revenue missed forecast by $1.1M. Primary driver was regional
underperformance in EMEA and APAC markets."

CFO: "Wait, this is different from this morning..."
```

**Tuesday Board Meeting - Power BI Copilot** (Same Question):
```
Board Member: "Can you show us the analysis again?"

CFO: "What caused Q3 revenue to drop below forecast?"

Power BI Copilot Response #3:
"Q3 shortfall was $1.1M (12% below plan). Key contributor was timing
of enterprise deals, with 3 major contracts slipping to Q4."

Board Member: "Is this accurate? You mentioned product mix yesterday..."
CFO: "Well, Copilot is nondeterministic, so..."
Board Member: "We're making decisions on data that changes each time?!"
```

**Microsoft's Own Warning**:
> "Copilot in Microsoft Fabric is nondeterministic, so it's not guaranteed
> to produce the same answer with the same prompt."

**Scoop - Same Question, Any Time**:
```
CFO: "@Scoop what caused Q3 revenue to drop below forecast?"

Scoop Response (IDENTICAL every time asked):
"Q3 Revenue Variance Analysis

PRIMARY CAUSE (47% of variance):
Enterprise deal slippage - $520K
- 3 deals moved to Q4 (identified: Acme Corp, TechCo, FinanceX)
- Root cause: CFO approval cycle averaging 31 days (vs 14 day target)
- Action: CFO engagement protocol for deals >$500K

SECONDARY CAUSE (31% of variance):
EMEA regional underperformance - $340K
- UK: -$180K (holiday seasonality)
- Germany: -$100K (sales rep departure June)
- France: -$60K (delayed product launch)
- Action: Q4 EMEA acceleration plan, backfill hire complete

TERTIARY CAUSE (22% of variance):
Product mix shift - $240K
- Lower-margin products: +15% volume, -$240K revenue
- Higher-margin products: -8% volume, -$180K
- Net effect: -$240K (volume partially offset mix)
- Action: Pricing strategy review Q4

ML Confidence: 94%
Historical pattern match: 89%

[Board-ready PowerPoint deck generated]"

MONDAY: Same answer
TUESDAY: Same answer
BOARD MEETING: Same answer (with backup)
CFO REPUTATION: Intact
DECISION QUALITY: High confidence
```

**Business Impact**:
- Power BI: Cannot trust results for board decisions, embarrassing inconsistency
- Scoop: Deterministic results, professional consistency, ML confidence scoring
- Difference: Experimentation tool vs decision-making platform

### Example 3: The Investigation That Can't Continue

**Setup**: Sales VP needs to understand why pipeline is down.

**Power BI Copilot Experience**:
```
VP Sales: "Why is pipeline down this quarter?"

Copilot: "Pipeline is $4.2M, down 18% from last quarter."

VP Sales: "Why did it drop?"

Copilot: "Pipeline is $4.2M, down 18% from last quarter."
(Same answer - no context retention)

VP Sales: "What's causing the decrease?"

Copilot: "Here are the top opportunities by value..."
(Different answer - didn't understand "causing")

VP Sales: "Can you investigate the root cause?"

Copilot: "Can't currently answer questions that require generating
new insights" (Microsoft documentation)

Result: VP Sales spends 2 hours manually analyzing data in Excel,
building hypothesis tests, creating charts. Never finds root cause
because lacks ML tools.
```

**Scoop Experience**:
```
VP Sales: "@Scoop why is pipeline down this quarter?"

Scoop (30-second investigation):
"Pipeline Decline Investigation - Q4 2025

PRIMARY CAUSE IDENTIFIED (72% of decline):
Rep Productivity Variance
- Top 3 reps on vacation/training (Oct 15-31): -$890K pipeline
- 2 new reps in ramp period (<90 days): -$450K vs target
- 1 rep on PIP with reduced activity: -$280K
- Combined impact: -$1.62M pipeline (actual -$1.8M total)

Pattern identified: Hiring cohort timing issue
- Q3 hires not productive until Q4 (8-12 week ramp)
- Vacation policy concentrated in October
- Creates predictable pipeline dip Q4

SECONDARY FACTOR (22% of decline):
Lead Quality Degradation
- Marketing campaign X: 45% MQL-to-SQL vs 62% baseline
- Source: Paid social (new channel, untested)
- Impact: -$720K pipeline from lower conversion

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
1. Adjust hiring timing (onboard June/July for Q4 pipeline)
2. Stagger vacation policy (max 1 top rep out at a time)
3. Pause underperforming paid social campaigns
4. Expected Q1 pipeline: $6.8M (recovery to baseline + actions)

ML Confidence: 84%
Hypotheses tested: 7
Queries executed: 9

[Rep productivity dashboard]
[Campaign performance comparison]
[Q1 forecast model with confidence intervals]
[Personal Deck card created: 'Pipeline Health']"

Result: VP Sales has root cause, action plan, and forecast in
30 seconds. Can present to exec team with confidence.
```

**Business Impact**:
- Power BI: Dead-end after first answer, user must manually investigate (hours)
- Scoop: Complete root cause analysis with intervention strategy (30 seconds)
- Microsoft admits: "Can't answer questions that require generating new insights"
- Scoop specializes: Multi-pass investigation is core architecture

## 10. SALES GUIDANCE (How to use this in conversations)

**Discovery Questions to Ask**:
1. "When your business users ask 'why did revenue drop?'—does Power BI Copilot investigate root cause or just show the data?" ← **NEW LEAD QUESTION**
2. "Can business users ask complex analytical questions like 'show accounts where revenue grew more than 20% this quarter' without IT building custom DAX measures?"
3. "Have you looked at Power BI Copilot? What's been your experience with the F64 capacity requirement?"
4. "How do your business users currently access Power BI—do they create their own reports or request dashboards from IT?"
5. "What's your typical timeline from 'we need a new dashboard' to 'business users can access it'?"

**If They Say**: "We already use Power BI, isn't Copilot the natural next step?"
**We Respond**: "Many Power BI customers are evaluating Copilot. The key question is: what do your business users need? Power BI Copilot is primarily an AI assistant for analysts building dashboards (70% of Microsoft's positioning). For business users, it's a text-to-query interface—handles simple 'what' questions like 'show revenue by region' but cannot investigate 'why' questions or handle complex analytical filtering. Microsoft explicitly states: 'Copilot doesn't answer follow-up questions' and 'Can't answer questions that require generating new insights.' Scoop is different—it's an AI data analyst that investigates, handles complex subqueries automatically, and works on any data without requiring semantic models. You can keep Power BI for traditional reporting and use Scoop for investigation and analysis. Additionally, Scoop has zero infrastructure costs versus Copilot's $67K/year F64 requirement."

**If They Say**: "Microsoft will improve Copilot over time, shouldn't we wait?"
**We Respond**: "Absolutely, Microsoft is investing. But the investigation limitation is architectural—Power BI Copilot is designed as a text-to-query interface for IT-built semantic models, not an AI data analyst. The inability to handle complex analytical filtering ('show opportunities from top 5 reps by win rate') or investigate 'why' questions is fundamental to the semantic model approach. Nondeterminism may improve with better LLM models, but the investigation gap will remain. Scoop is production-ready now with multi-pass investigation, automatic subquery generation, and deterministic results. You can adopt Scoop today, and if Microsoft Copilot evolves dramatically, you can reassess. But why wait 1-2 years when business users need investigation capabilities today?"

**If They Say**: "We're a Microsoft shop, so Copilot integration makes sense"
**We Respond**: "Being a Microsoft shop is smart for infrastructure. But even Microsoft customers use best-of-breed tools where Microsoft has gaps. Power BI Copilot is primarily designed for analysts building dashboards, not for business user investigation. Its 3% satisfaction rate (Gartner) reflects the gap between what business users need (investigation, complex analytics) and what it provides (simple text-to-query). Scoop integrates with your Microsoft data sources (SQL Server, Azure, Power BI datasets) but provides the AI data analyst capabilities Microsoft hasn't built yet. You keep Microsoft infrastructure, you add Scoop for business user investigation and analysis."

**If They Say**: "The $67K F64 cost is already in our budget for other Fabric features"
**We Respond**: "That helps with the infrastructure cost. But the fundamental challenges remain: Power BI Copilot cannot investigate 'why' questions (Microsoft explicitly states 'Can't answer questions that require generating new insights'), cannot handle complex analytical filtering (requires IT to build custom DAX measures for each pattern), and is bounded by semantic model scope (business users can only query what IT pre-built). Even with F64 capacity, Scoop provides AI data analyst capabilities—multi-pass investigation, automatic subquery generation, works on any data—that Copilot's text-to-query architecture doesn't have. Plus you save implementation costs ($40K-$80K) and Excel Copilot upsell ($72K/year for 200 users)."

**Demo Focus Areas** (for this competitor):
1. **Investigation demo** - "Why did revenue drop?" — show multi-pass analysis with root cause. Power BI stops at "what happened." PRIMARY DEMO.
2. **Complex query demo** - "Show opportunities from top 5 reps by win rate" — show automatic subquery generation (3 seconds). Explain Power BI needs IT to build custom DAX (1-2 weeks).
3. **Determinism demo** - Ask same question 3 times, show identical answer with confidence scoring. Contrast with Power BI's admitted nondeterminism.
4. **Cost calculator** - Show F64 + implementation + Excel Copilot vs Scoop. $131K-$267K vs $50K-$70K.
5. **30-second setup** - Connect to their data live, start asking questions. Contrast with 14-week Power BI timeline.
6. **Excel formulas** - Show VLOOKUP/SUMIFS working natively. Power BI requires $30/user/month extra Excel Copilot.

## MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE

**Quarterly Review** (Next: December 2025):
- [ ] Check if Microsoft has addressed nondeterminism (unlikely—fundamental LLM behavior)
- [ ] Review if F64 capacity pricing has changed (currently $67K/year)
- [ ] Update Gartner satisfaction stats (currently 3% significant value, 53% error rate)
- [ ] Check if follow-up questions are now supported (currently "one at a time")
- [ ] Verify Excel Copilot is still separate $30/user upsell
- [ ] Check if Congress ban has been lifted (security concerns)

**Triggered Updates** (Update immediately when):
- Microsoft announces deterministic mode or reliability improvements
- F64 capacity requirement removed or price drops significantly
- Follow-up question capability added (context retention)
- Excel formula support included in base Copilot
- Gartner publishes updated satisfaction survey
- Implementation timeline drops below 4 weeks (semantic model automation)

**Version History**:
- 2025-09-28: Investigation-first update - emphasis shift to 30% investigation (up from 20%), added "AI data analyst vs text-to-query" positioning, enhanced weakness #3 with complex "what" questions and semantic model boundary details
- 2025-09-27: Initial version based on BUA 32/100 scoring, Gartner 2025 survey, Microsoft documentation
