    ```
    If support_tickets > 3 AND last_login > 30 days:
      → 89% churn probability (134 customers at risk)
    If payment_failed AND usage < 10 hours/month:
      → 76% churn probability (67 customers at risk)
    ```
  - EM Clustering identifies 3 churn segments:
    1. "Abandoned Users" - Bought but never adopted (45% of churn)
    2. "Frustrated Power Users" - Heavy support tickets (30% of churn)
    3. "Price Shoppers" - Switched to competitor (25% of churn)
  - Specific trigger: Mobile app bug introduced in v2.3.1

## The Executive Summary

**Power BI Copilot Reality**:
- Costs $2.2M Year 1 (vs $3,588 for Scoop)
- Takes 14+ weeks to implement (vs 30 seconds)
- Requires 2 FTEs to maintain (vs zero)
- Delivers nondeterministic results (different each time)
- Has zero Excel support despite being Microsoft
- Cannot investigate "why" questions
- No APIs for developers
- 97% of IT leaders find no value (Gartner)

**Scoop Advantage**:
- 612x cheaper ($3,588 vs $2.2M)
- 20,000x faster setup (30 seconds vs 14 weeks)
- Investigates root causes automatically
- Works with existing Excel knowledge
