## YOUR MISSION
Complete Phases 1-3: Recovery, URL Verification, and Customer Evidence Mining

## PHASE 1: Recovery & Inventory
1. Check `../../archive/` for any Power BI related files
2. Check `../../evidence/` for existing Power BI content
3. List all existing files in this directory
4. Read any existing research files to understand what we already know
5. Document what was recovered in `research/existing_research.md`

## PHASE 2: URL Verification & Documentation
1. Read all files in this directory and extract URLs
2. Verify which URLs are still active
3. Fetch official Microsoft documentation:
   - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/copilot-introduction
   - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/copilot-enable-power-bi
4. Document all working URLs in `evidence/verified_urls.md`

## PHASE 3: Customer Evidence Mining
Execute these searches with WebSearch:
