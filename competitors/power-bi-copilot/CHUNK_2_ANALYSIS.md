# CHUNK 2: Analysis & Battle Card Creation - Power BI Copilot

## YOUR MISSION
Read the evidence collected in Chunk 1 and transform it into powerful sales ammunition. Create battle-ready documentation that sales can use to win deals.

## CONTEXT
- **Previous Work**: Read `research/evidence.md` from Chunk 1
- **Our Product**: Scoop (investigate WHY, not just WHAT)
- **Goal**: Turn raw evidence into sales weapons
- **Output**: Update battle card and create comparison docs

## EXECUTION PLAN

### Step 1: Read and Synthesize Evidence
```
1. Read research/evidence.md completely
2. Identify the TOP 10 most damaging problems
3. Group problems into themes
4. Rank by business impact
```

### Step 2: BUPAF Scoring
Score each dimension based on evidence found:

#### Independence (Can business users work alone?)
- Look for: Licensing complexity, IT dependency, setup requirements
- Score: 0-10 (0 = requires constant IT, 10 = complete independence)
- Evidence: [Quote specific problems from evidence.md]

#### Analytical Depth (Investigation vs single queries)
- Look for: Nondeterministic outputs, hallucinations, wrong data
- Score: 0-10 (0 = single queries only, 10 = deep investigation)
- Evidence: [Quote specific limitations]

#### Workflow Integration (Excel, Slack, PowerPoint native)
- Look for: Integration limitations, export restrictions
- Score: 0-10 (0 = no integration, 10 = seamless)
- Evidence: [Quote specific issues]

#### Business Communication (Natural language understanding)
- Look for: Misunderstandings, requires data prep, naming conventions
- Score: 0-10 (0 = technical only, 10 = perfect understanding)
- Evidence: [Quote specific failures]

#### Visual Intelligence (Presentation-ready outputs)
- Look for: Can't edit visuals, manual refresh needed, wrong charts
- Score: 0-10 (0 = requires rebuild, 10 = presentation ready)
- Evidence: [Quote specific problems]

### Step 3: Create Fatal Flaws List
Identify the 5 FATAL FLAWS that kill deals:

```markdown
## FATAL FLAWS - Power BI Copilot

### 1. [Flaw Name]
**The Problem**: [One sentence]
**The Evidence**: "[Customer quote]"
**The Impact**: [Business consequence]
**Scoop Advantage**: [How we solve this]

### 2. [Continue for all 5]
```

### Step 4: Price Comparison
Create a clear cost comparison:

```markdown
## Cost Reality Check

### Power BI Copilot (200 users)
- F64 Capacity: $[amount]/month
- OR P1 Premium: $[amount]/month
- Annual Cost: $[amount]
- Hidden Costs: [list]
- Total TCO: $[amount]

### Scoop (200 users)
- Pro Plan: $299/month total
- Annual Cost: $3,588
- No hidden costs
- Total TCO: $3,588

### Difference: [X]x more expensive
```

### Step 5: Update BATTLE_CARD.md
Update the existing battle card with:

```markdown
# Battle Card - Power BI Copilot

## Quick Win Points
1. "Did you know Power BI Copilot requires $60,000 minimum investment?"
2. "Microsoft admits Copilot outputs are nondeterministic"
3. [Add 3 more killer points]

## Evidence Vault
- [URL 1]: [What it proves]
- [URL 2]: [What it proves]
- [Top 5 most damaging sources]

## Customer Horror Stories
"[Quote 1]" - [Source]
"[Quote 2]" - [Source]
"[Quote 3]" - [Source]

## Technical Knockouts
1. [Technical limitation]: [Why it matters]
2. [Continue for top 5]

## The Scoop Difference
Where they fail, we succeed:
1. Power BI: [Problem] → Scoop: [Solution]
2. [Continue for top 5]

## BUPAF Score
- Independence: [X]/10 (Power BI) vs 8/10 (Scoop)
- Analytical: [X]/10 vs 9/10
- Workflow: [X]/10 vs 8/10
- Communication: [X]/10 vs 7/10
- Visual: [X]/10 vs 7/10
- TOTAL: [X]/50 vs 38/50

## Objection Handlers
"We already have Power BI"
→ "That's perfect! Scoop complements Power BI by..."

"Copilot will improve"
→ "Microsoft admitted in their docs that..."

## Discovery Questions
1. "How much are you paying for Power BI Premium?"
2. "Have you noticed inconsistent results from Copilot?"
3. [Add 3 more]
```

### Step 6: Create Sales Email Template
Create `outputs/email_template.md`:

```markdown
# Email Template - Power BI Users

Subject: Quick question about your Power BI Copilot experience

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] is using Power BI. Quick question - have you run into the issue where Copilot gives different answers to the same question?

Microsoft recently acknowledged this "nondeterministic output" problem in their documentation. It's causing a lot of teams to get conflicting insights from identical queries.

We're seeing companies supplement Power BI with Scoop specifically for reliable investigation capabilities. Unlike Copilot which requires $60K+ in Premium capacity, Scoop works with your existing Power BI at just $299/month total.

Worth a quick call to explore? We can show you how [Similar Company] is using both together.

P.S. Here's Microsoft's admission about the nondeterministic outputs if you want to check: [URL]

## OUTPUT CHECKLIST
- [ ] BUPAF fully scored with evidence
- [ ] BATTLE_CARD.md updated
- [ ] 5 Fatal Flaws documented
- [ ] Price comparison completed
- [ ] Email template created
- [ ] All claims have source URLs

## COMPLETION
When done:
1. Verify all outputs are created/updated
2. Ensure every claim has evidence
3. Output: "CHUNK 2 COMPLETE: Battle card ready, [X] fatal flaws documented"

## TIME ESTIMATE
This should take 10-15 minutes with all evidence already gathered.
