# Power BI Copilot Cold Outreach Templates

## Template 1: The Nondeterministic Problem

**Subject**: Quick question about Power BI Copilot reliability

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] is using Power BI Copilot for analytics.

Microsoft recently admitted in their documentation that Copilot is "nondeterministic" and "not guaranteed to produce the same answer with the same prompt."

Has your team experienced getting different answers when asking the same question twice? We've heard this is causing issues with board presentations where numbers don't match.

If consistent, investigation-based analytics would be valuable, I'd love to show you how Scoop complements Power BI with deterministic results - same question, same answer, every time.

Worth a quick 15-minute call next week?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. Here's Microsoft's exact warning: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/copilot-semantic-models

## Template 2: The Hidden Cost Shock

**Subject**: Did you budget $67,392 for Power BI Copilot infrastructure?

Hi [Name],

Quick question - when [Company] evaluated Power BI Copilot, were you aware of the F64 capacity requirement that costs $67,392/year minimum?

Many organizations discover this hidden infrastructure tax only after their PPU licenses ($24/user) don't include Copilot access.

Plus, if you want Excel integration, that's another $30/user/month for Copilot Pro - a completely separate product.

We help companies get AI-powered analytics without the infrastructure overhead. Scoop works with your existing Power BI data but delivers insights directly in Excel with =SCOOP().

Interested in seeing how we could save you $67k+ while improving your analytics capabilities?

## Template 3: The Excel Integration Gap

**Subject**: Power BI Copilot â‰  Excel COPILOT (expensive lesson)

[Name],

Did you know that Power BI Copilot and Excel COPILOT are completely separate products requiring different licenses?

Many [Industry] companies like yours assume their Power BI investment includes Excel AI features. Unfortunately:
- Power BI Copilot requires $67k/year F64 capacity
- Excel COPILOT requires additional $30/user Copilot Pro licenses
- They don't share data or integrate

Scoop provides true Excel integration with your BI data through native =SCOOP() functions - one product, one price, actual integration.

Would you like to see a 10-minute demo of real Excel-native analytics?

Best regards,

## Template 4: The Data Prep Prison

**Subject**: How many weeks did Power BI Copilot data prep take?

Hi [Name],

Microsoft states that "model owners need to invest in prepping their data for AI" before Power BI Copilot works properly.

I'm curious - how long did [Company]'s data preparation phase take? We're hearing 14+ weeks is typical for star schema conversion, metadata enrichment, and AI optimization.

What if you could skip all that prep work?

Scoop analyzes your existing data immediately - no schema changes, no naming conventions, no metadata requirements. It just works with what you have.

Worth exploring how to reclaim those lost weeks?

## Template 5: The Geographic Restriction

**Subject**: Can your [Dubai/Singapore/India] office use Power BI Copilot?

[Name],

Quick geography check - does [Company] have offices in any of these locations?
- India, Indonesia, Korea
- Qatar, UAE, South Africa
- Any sovereign cloud regions

Power BI Copilot is unavailable in these regions due to GPU limitations. Microsoft has no timeline for expansion.

Scoop works globally with no restrictions. Your Dubai team gets the same AI analytics as your New York team.

If global coverage matters for [Company], let's talk?

Best,
[Your Name]

## Follow-Up Template

**Subject**: Re: Power BI Copilot challenges

[Name],

Following up on my previous note about Power BI Copilot's limitations.

I've compiled three specific examples where Microsoft admits problems:

1. "Outputs are nondeterministic" - Official documentation
2. "Can produce misleading outputs" - Their warning, not mine
3. "Extensive data preparation required" - 14+ weeks typical

If you're experiencing any of these issues, we should talk. Scoop customers switched after discovering these same problems.

Can we schedule 15 minutes this week?
