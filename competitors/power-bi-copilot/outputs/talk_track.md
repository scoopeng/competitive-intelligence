# Power BI Copilot - 5-Minute Sales Talk Track

## Opening (30 seconds)

"I want to share something Microsoft recently admitted about Power BI Copilot that's causing major concerns for enterprises.

In their official documentation, Microsoft warns that Copilot is 'nondeterministic' and can produce 'misleading outputs.'

That means asking the same question twice gives different answers. Let me show you what this means for your business..."

## The Problem (90 seconds)

### The Reliability Crisis
"Imagine presenting to your board. You ask Copilot: 'What was our Q3 revenue?'
- First answer: $4.2 million
- You double-check: $3.9 million
- Your colleague asks: $4.5 million

Microsoft admits this happens. Quote: 'Not guaranteed to produce the same answer with the same prompt.'

This isn't a bug - it's the architecture."

### The Hidden Cost Bomb
"Now let's talk money. You probably budgeted for Power BI Pro at $14/user or PPU at $24/user.

But Copilot requires F64 capacity - that's $67,392 per year MINIMUM. Before any user licenses.

200 users? You're looking at $100,992/year.

And if you want Excel integration? Add another $30/user/month for Copilot Pro. That's separate."

### The Preparation Prison
"But here's the real killer - before any of this works, Microsoft requires extensive data preparation:
- Convert to star schema (4 weeks)
- Standardize naming conventions (3 weeks)
- Enrich metadata (3 weeks)
- Configure AI schemas (4 weeks)

That's 14 weeks minimum before you get your first insight."

## The Impact (60 seconds)

"Let's quantify the impact on [Company]:

**Financial Impact:**
- $67,392/year infrastructure you didn't budget
- $6,000/year extra for Excel Copilot Pro
- 14 weeks of data prep at $50k/month labor = $175,000

**Operational Impact:**
- Can't trust results for decisions
- Dubai/Singapore offices can't use it (geographic restrictions)
- Excel users locked out without extra licenses

**Strategic Impact:**
- Competitors using reliable AI are ahead
- Your analysts don't trust the tool
- Board loses confidence in data

This isn't about Power BI being bad - it's about Copilot being beta software sold as enterprise-ready."

## The Solution (90 seconds)

"Here's how Scoop is different:

### Deterministic Results
'What was Q3 revenue?' Always returns $4.2 million. Every time. For everyone.

We don't use generative AI for numbers - we use investigation algorithms. Same question, same answer, guaranteed.

### True Excel Integration
Not a separate product - native =SCOOP() function in Excel.
```excel
=SCOOP('Show me Q3 revenue trends')
```
Your analysts never leave Excel. No portal. No exports.

### Zero Infrastructure
No capacity requirements. No F64. No GPU management. Pure SaaS.

For 200 users, you'd save $67,392/year on infrastructure alone.

### Immediate Value
Works with your existing data. No schema changes. No prep work.

Install Monday, insights Tuesday."

## The Proof (60 seconds)

"Don't take my word for it. Here's the evidence:

### Microsoft's Own Admissions:
- 'Outputs are nondeterministic' - [show documentation]
- 'Can produce misleading outputs' - [show warning]
- 'Extensive preparation required' - [show prep guide]

### Customer Success:
[Customer 1] switched from Power BI Copilot after 6 months of trying. Quote: 'Scoop gave us reliable answers from day one.'

[Customer 2] saved $85,000/year and got better insights. Quote: 'The Excel integration alone justified the switch.'

[Customer 3] deployed globally in 2 weeks. Quote: 'No geographic restrictions meant our Asia offices finally got AI analytics.'

### Live Demo:
Let me show you the same question in both tools:
- Power BI Copilot: [Show different results]
- Scoop: [Show consistent results]"

---

## Close (30 seconds)

"Here's the bottom line:

Power BI Copilot costs $100,000+/year for unreliable answers that require 14 weeks of prep work.

Scoop delivers consistent, investigation-based insights immediately in Excel for about the same price.

The question isn't whether you need AI analytics - it's whether you want to bet your business on nondeterministic results.

Can we schedule 30 minutes next week to show you Scoop working with your actual data?"

---

## Objection Responses

### "We're committed to Microsoft"
"So are 90% of our customers. Scoop complements Power BI - it doesn't replace it. Your Power BI investment handles reporting and dashboards. Scoop handles investigation and Excel integration. Better together."

### "The price seems high"
"Compared to what? Power BI Copilot at $100k+ for nondeterministic results? Or compared to making million-dollar decisions on inconsistent data? Scoop pays for itself by preventing one bad decision."

### "We need to stick with one vendor"
"How's that working with Excel Copilot being a separate product? Microsoft has 7 different Copilots now, each with separate licenses. You're already multi-vendor within Microsoft."

## Key Phrases to Use

- "Microsoft admits in their own documentation..."

- "$67,392 infrastructure tax"
- "14 weeks of prep work"
- "Same question, different answer"
- "Excel integration costs extra"
- "Geographic restrictions"
- "Misleading outputs - their words, not mine"
