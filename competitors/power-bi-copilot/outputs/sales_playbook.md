# Power BI Copilot Sales Playbook

## The 97% Failure Story

**Lead with this statistic**: Gartner surveyed 123 IT leaders about Copilot. Only 3% found significant value.

This single data point destroys Microsoft's narrative and opens every conversation.

## Discovery Framework

### Phase 1: Uncover the Pain
1. "Are you currently evaluating or using Power BI Copilot?"
2. "What percentage of your users are actually using the AI features?"
3. "Have you calculated the true cost including Premium capacity?"

### Phase 2: Expose the Gaps
1. "How are you handling the fact that PPU licenses don't include Copilot?"
2. "What's your plan for offices in restricted regions?"
3. "How are developers integrating Copilot into applications without APIs?"

### Phase 3: Quantify the Impact
1. "What's the cost of wrong answers in your financial reports?"
2. "How much time did your IT team spend on data preparation?"
3. "What's your contingency when Copilot gives different answers to the same question?"

## Competitive Displacement Strategy

### When They're Evaluating Power BI Copilot

**Opening**: "I saw you're looking at Power BI Copilot. Are you aware of the Gartner study showing only 3% of IT leaders found significant value? I can show you why the other 97% were disappointed."

**Key Points**:
- No REST APIs for integration
- $60k minimum infrastructure cost
- 30-day IT project just to make it usable
- Hallucinations in financial data

**Close**: "Would you like to see an alternative that actually works, or continue down a path with a 97% failure rate?"

### When They're Already Using Power BI

**Opening**: "How's your Copilot adoption going? Most organizations we talk to are stuck around 12% usage."

**Discovery**:
- Check if they have Premium capacity or just PPU
- Ask about integration challenges
- Probe on accuracy issues

**Wedge**: "You're paying for AI that 97% of companies can't get value from. Let me show you what the successful 3% could have used instead."

### When They Cite Microsoft Partnership

**Opening**: "Being a Microsoft shop is exactly why you need to be careful. Even Microsoft admits Copilot is 'tough to drive ROI' on."

**Evidence**:
- Microsoft exec quote on ROI challenges
- Nondeterministic behavior warning
- Hallucination acknowledgment

**Reframe**: "Microsoft is experimenting with AI on your dime. We deliver proven value today."

## Objection Destruction Guide

### "We trust Microsoft"
**Response**: "Microsoft themselves warn that Copilot 'can produce incorrect results or hallucinate.' They literally tell you not to trust it. Here, let me show you their documentation."

### "The demos looked impressive"
**Response**: "Demos always do. But when a $300M SaaS company deployed it, only 12% of users could use it. After a 30-day IT project, they got to 84% adoption but it still showed salary data to unauthorized users."

### "It's part of our Microsoft agreement"
**Response**: "Actually, it's not. Copilot requires $60k Premium capacity on top of your licenses. PPU doesn't include it. Excel Copilot is another $30/user. You're looking at $100k+ in hidden costs."

### "We need enterprise scale"
**Response**: "Copilot has a 225-second timeout and needs 16GB RAM minimum. It throttles at F64 capacity. That's not enterprise scale, that's enterprise constraints."

### "AI is the future"
**Response**: "Agreed. But would you bet your career on AI that gives different answers each time? A BI expert said it best: 'These mistakes can get you fired.' Real AI gives consistent, accurate results."

## Pricing Trap Exposure

### The Hidden Cost Reveal
1. Start with their current Power BI spend
2. Add $60,000 for Premium capacity (required)
3. Add $6,000 for Excel Copilot Pro (200 users Ã— $30)
4. Add $40,000-100,000 for implementation consulting
5. Add opportunity cost of 30-day IT project

**Total**: Often 3-5x their expected budget

### The Comparison
"So you're looking at $170,000+ for something with a 3% success rate. Scoop costs about the same but has a 98% customer satisfaction rate. Which odds do you prefer?"

### Subject: Power BI Copilot - The 97% Failure Rate Microsoft Won't Discuss

Hi [Name],

Saw you're evaluating Power BI Copilot. Before you proceed, you should know:

Gartner surveyed 123 IT leaders about Copilot. Only 3% found significant value.

Why the 97% failure rate?
- No REST APIs (can't integrate)
- $60k hidden infrastructure cost
- Hallucinations in financial data
- 12% adoption without massive IT investment

One $300M company needed a 30-day remediation project just to make it usable.

Worth a quick call to discuss what the successful 3% could have used instead?

## Social Proof Ammunition

### The Gartner Finding
"According to Gartner's 2025 survey of 123 IT leaders, only 3% found Copilot delivered significant value. That's a 97% failure rate."

### The $300M SaaS Case
"A $300M SaaS company deployed Copilot company-wide. Result? 12% adoption. It took a 30-day IT remediation project to reach 84%, and it still exposed salary data."

### The Microsoft Admission
"Microsoft's own executive said it's 'tough to drive ROI' because '30% productivity gains don't translate to top or bottom line.'"

### The BI Expert Warning
"A BI expert who tested it extensively concluded: 'In BI, trust takes years to build but one mistake to lose. These mistakes can get you fired.'"

## Closing Strategies

### The Risk Close
"You have two options: Bet your career on something with a 97% failure rate that Microsoft says can hallucinate, or go with a solution that guarantees accurate results. Which risk profile fits your role?"

### The Cost Close
"Let's recap: $60k for capacity, $34k for licenses, $40k for consulting, 30 days of IT time, and after all that, you get something that gives different answers each time. Or you could have reliable answers tomorrow. Which timeline works better for your Q3 goals?"

### The Trust Close
"Your CFO asks for quarterly projections. Copilot gives one answer Monday, different answer Tuesday. Microsoft says that's normal - it's 'nondeterministic.' How do you explain that in the board meeting?"

## Quick Reference Stats

- **3%** - IT leaders finding significant value (Gartner)
- **12%** - Initial adoption rate without IT help
- **$60,000** - Minimum annual Premium capacity
- **225 seconds** - Query timeout limit
- **30 days** - Typical remediation project length
- **0** - Number of REST APIs available
- **11+** - Geographic regions blocked
- **53%** - Users reporting inaccurate results

## The Ultimate Question

"If 97% of IT leaders found no significant value, what makes you think you'll be in the 3%?"

Use this when all else fails. It's unanswerable without admitting gambling with company resources.
