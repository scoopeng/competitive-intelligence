# The Reality of Snowflake Intelligence UI

## Executive Summary  
**UPDATE (Aug 2025): Snowflake Intelligence (in preview) now includes basic charting (bar, line, pie). However, Cortex Analyst - the core SQL generation engine - remains visualization-free and stateless.**

## Critical Distinction: Intelligence vs Analyst
- **Cortex Analyst**: The SQL generation engine (no visualizations, stateless)
- **Snowflake Intelligence**: Preview UI wrapper with basic charts (bar, line, pie)
- **Key Limitation**: Still fundamentally stateless - cannot reference previous charts or results

## What Snowflake Doesn't Tell You

### Limited Chart Types (Intelligence Preview)
- Only 3 chart types: bar, line, pie
- Cannot switch visualization type without re-querying
- No advanced visualizations (heatmaps, scatter plots, treemaps, etc.)
- Still stateless - each chart request starts fresh

### The Actual Implementation Burden

#### Developer Requirements (Not Optional)
```bash
# This is what "Snowflake Intelligence" setup actually looks like:
git clone https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake-demo-streamlit
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Now write 40-80 hours of custom code...
```

#### GitHub Authentication Setup
```sql
-- Create PAT secret for GitHub access
CREATE OR REPLACE SECRET my_git_secret
  TYPE = password
  USERNAME = 'github-username'
  PASSWORD = 'github-pat-token';

-- Required for EVERY deployment
```

#### Semantic Model Creation (Per Dataset)
```yaml
# Must map EVERY column manually
semantic_model:
  name: Business Model
  tables:
    - name: YOUR_TABLE
      dimensions:
        - name: customer_id
          expr: CUST_ID_2024_V3_FINAL  # Your actual column name
        # Hundreds more mappings...
```

**Time Required**: 
- Initial setup: 3-4 months
- Per dataset: 4-8 hours
- Maintenance: $100-200k/year in developer time

## What Users Actually Get

### Snowflake Intelligence (Preview - Aug 2025)
```
User: "Show me sales trend"
Result: Basic line chart (one of 3 types available)

User: "Switch to bar chart"
Result: Must re-query entirely (no state preservation)

User: "Show that by region" 
Result: ERROR - doesn't know what "that" refers to
```

### Critical Limitations
- **3 chart types only**: Bar, line, pie
- **Cannot switch chart type**: Must re-query from scratch
- **No state preservation**: Each request independent
- **No drill-down**: Cannot say "drill into Q1" on existing chart
- **No advanced analytics**: No ML insights, just basic charts

### Still Stateless
Even with the UI:
- Cannot reference previous results
- Cannot say "drill into that"
- Cannot accumulate filters
- Each query starts fresh

## Comparison to Scoop

### Scoop Setup
1. Install browser extension (2 minutes)
2. Connect to data (30 seconds)
3. Start asking questions

### Scoop Experience
```
User: "Show me sales trend"
Scoop: [Interactive line chart with trend analysis]

User: "Switch to bar chart"
Scoop: [Instantly changes visualization]

User: "Drill into Q1"
Scoop: [Adds filter, maintains context]
```

## The Bottom Line

**Snowflake Intelligence (Preview)** = Basic 3-chart UI + still stateless + cannot switch visualizations

**Scoop** = 15+ chart types + stateful conversations + instant visualization switching + ML insights

Even with basic charting, Snowflake Intelligence still lacks:
- State preservation (cannot reference previous results)
- Visualization switching (must re-query for different chart type)
- Progressive exploration (each query starts fresh)
- Advanced analytics (no ML, just basic aggregations)
