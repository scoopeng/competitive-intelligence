# Snowflake Cortex Analyst - Competitive Intelligence

## ðŸš¨ The Fundamental Difference: WHY vs WHAT

**Snowflake tells you WHAT happened. Scoop tells you WHY it happened and WHAT TO DO about it.**

This isn't about SQL generation or technical features. It's about depth of analysis and business value.

## What Actually Differentiates

### 1. Business User Empowerment
**Cortex Intelligence**: Business users need to formulate precise questions
**Scoop**: Business users can ask vague questions and get guided to insights

### 2. ML/Investigation Capabilities
**Query**: "Why are customers churning?"
- Cortex: Returns GROUP BY aggregations (raw data)
- Scoop: Returns decision tree with feature importance and p-values

### 3. Multi-Step Operations  
**Query**: "Calculate quartiles then filter outliers"
- Cortex: Cannot chain operations (single SQL limitation)
- Scoop: Query JSON handles multi-pass execution naturally

### 4. Consistency & Governance
- Cortex: Different SQL each time, depends on LLM mood
- Scoop: Structured Query JSON, saveable and shareable patterns

## Test Results Summary

### Key Test Results 
**Cortex Analyst (COMPLETE function)**: Can generate complex SQL successfully
**Cortex Intelligence (Preview UI)**: Limited to 3 chart types, no deep analysis
**What's Missing**: Investigation capabilities, ML insights, actionable recommendations

## For Sales Teams

### Sales Positioning
**Lead with**: "Help me reduce churn" vs "Show me churn rate"
**Emphasize**: Investigation and recommendations, not query capabilities
**Remember**: Business users don't care about SQL - they care about outcomes

### The Killer Demos:

1. **Churn Reduction**
   - Snowflake: "18% churned" (a number)
   - Scoop: Complete retention strategy with ML-identified risk factors

2. **Pipeline Optimization**
   - Snowflake: "Stage 3 has 45 deals" (a count)
   - Scoop: Bottleneck analysis with specific deals to accelerate

3. **Campaign Performance**
   - Snowflake: "CTR is 2.3%" (a metric)
   - Scoop: Which campaigns to optimize and expected lift

### The Key Message
"While Snowflake users are still gathering data, Scoop users are already taking action."
