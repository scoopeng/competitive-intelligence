# Iterative Suggestions for Snowflake Cortex Comparison Webpage

## What's Working Well (Keep These)
✅ **WHY vs WHAT framework** - This is our strongest differentiator
✅ **Deep investigation example** - The 5-10 coordinated analyses explanation  
✅ **Monday morning scenario** - Concrete and relatable
✅ **Conversation context quote** - Direct from Snowflake docs
✅ **Business role examples** - Sales, Marketing, Customer Success scenarios

## Suggested Refinements

### 1. Clarify the Product Distinction (Add near top)
**Current**: Webpage doesn't distinguish between Cortex Analyst and Intelligence
**Suggested Addition**:
```
What We're Actually Comparing:
• Cortex Analyst: An API function (COMPLETE) that generates SQL - works fine
• Cortex Intelligence: The preview UI at ai.snowflake.com - what business users would actually use
• We compete with Intelligence (the UI), not Analyst (the function)
```

### 2. Reframe the "43% Failure" Headline
**Current**: "Why 43% of business questions fail in Snowflake's AI"
**Better**: "Why Snowflake Intelligence Can't Answer 'Why' Questions"
**Reasoning**: Focus on capability gaps, not percentage metrics that distract

### 3. Strengthen Business User Empowerment Theme
**Add a section**:
```
What Business User Empowerment Actually Means:
• Without IT Support: Get insights independently
• Without SQL Knowledge: Natural language only
• Without Training: Productive immediately  
• Without Waiting: No tickets, instant insights
```

### 4. Verify Specific Claims
**Review these for accuracy**:
- "=SCOOP() Excel formula" → Verify if this exact feature exists
- "$299/month" pricing → Confirm current pricing
- "0% Causal Analysis" → Soften to "Cannot perform root cause analysis"
- "33% Time Intelligence" → Consider removing specific percentages

### 5. Add More on Office Integration Reality
**Expand this section with**:
- Mention that Snowflake requires manual copy/paste for PowerPoint
- Clarify that Scoop exports formatted Excel workbooks, not just CSVs
- Emphasize scheduled delivery (reports waiting Monday morning)

### 6. Include Decision Tree Visual Example
**Add a simple visual showing**:
```
Scoop's Answer to "Why are customers churning?":
├─ Contract Type (65% influence)
│  └─ Month-to-month → Target with annual incentives
├─ Tenure < 6 months (30% influence)  
│  └─ Implement 30-day onboarding
└─ No integrations (22% influence)
   └─ Drive adoption in first week
```

### 7. Tone Down Absolute Statements
**Soften these**:
- "0% Context Retention" → "Cannot reference previous query results"
- "Cannot answer any 'why' questions" → "Limited to SQL aggregations for causal questions"
- "None of This" → "Not available in preview"

### 8. Add Call-Out Box for Key Differentiator
**Highlight box**:
```
THE KEY INSIGHT:
Both tools can count your customers.
Only Scoop can tell you why they're leaving 
and exactly what to do about it.
```

### 9. Include Cortex Intelligence Limitations
**Add specifics about the preview**:
- Only 3 chart types (bar, line, pie)
- Available only at ai.snowflake.com
- No API access for integration
- No saved queries or templates
- No scheduled reports

### 10. End with Empowerment Message
**Current ending**: Focus on demo/trial
**Better ending**: 
```
The Bottom Line for Business Users:
With Snowflake Intelligence, you need IT to help formulate queries.
With Scoop, you get answers to questions you didn't know how to ask.

That's business user empowerment.
```

## What to Remove/De-emphasize
❌ Specific percentage claims without context (43%, 57%, 92%)
❌ Technical jargon (SQL success rates)
❌ Overly aggressive competitive statements
❌ Claims we can't verify (exact pricing, specific features)

## Overall Tone Adjustment
- From: "Snowflake fails at everything"
- To: "Snowflake Intelligence handles basic questions; Scoop enables investigation and action"

This maintains competitive positioning while being more credible and defensible.
