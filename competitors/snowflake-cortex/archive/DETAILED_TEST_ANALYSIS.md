# DETAILED TEST ANALYSIS: WHAT WAS TESTED AND HOW

## Testing Methodology

### Three-Layer Validation Framework
Each query was evaluated across three critical dimensions:

1. **SQL Generation** - Did Cortex Analyst produce valid SQL?
2. **SQL Execution** - Did the SQL run without errors?
3. **Semantic Validation** - Does the SQL actually answer the business question?

### Evaluation Criteria

#### Layer 1: SQL Generation
- ✅ **PASS**: Returns SQL starting with SELECT
- ❌ **FAIL**: Returns text explanation or no SQL

#### Layer 2: SQL Execution
- ✅ **PASS**: SQL runs and returns data
- ❌ **FAIL**: Syntax errors, missing columns, etc.

#### Layer 3: Semantic Validation (Most Critical)
Using LLM-based validation inspired by Scoop's approach:
- **Pattern Matching**: Check for required SQL patterns
- **Business Logic**: Verify results make business sense
- **Completeness**: Ensure query fully answers the question

  MONTHLYCHARGES,
  SUM(MONTHLYCHARGES) OVER (ORDER BY CUSTOMERID) AS running_total
FROM TELCO_DATA
ORDER BY CUSTOMERID
LIMIT 10
```
**Evaluation:**

**Generated SQL:**
```sql
SELECT 
  PHONESERVICE,
  INTERNETSERVICE,

  SUM(CASE WHEN CHURN = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS churned,
  (100.0 - (SUM(CASE WHEN CHURN = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*))) AS loyalty_rate
FROM TELCO_DATA
GROUP BY PHONESERVICE, INTERNETSERVICE
ORDER BY loyalty_rate DESC
```
**Evaluation:**
- ✓ SQL Generated: Yes
- ✓ SQL Executed: 8 rows

### 4. ADVANCED SQL CAPABILITIES

#### ✅ Test AS01: "Show customers with monthly charges between $50 and $100"
**Generated SQL:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM TELCO_DATA
WHERE MONTHLYCHARGES BETWEEN 50 AND 100
```
**Evaluation:**

**Result**: FAILED - Query correct but no matching data

#### ❌ Test AS03: "Calculate churn rate avoiding division by zero"
**Generated SQL:**
```sql
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN COUNT(*) = 0 THEN 0
    ELSE SUM(CASE WHEN CHURN = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / NULLIF(COUNT(*), 0)
  END AS churn_rate
FROM TELCO_DATA
```
**Evaluation:**
- ✓ SQL Generated: Yes
- ✓ SQL Executed: 1 row

**Result**: FAILED - Safe division works but missing grouping

#### ❌ Test AS04: "Show top 10 customers by total charges"
**Generated SQL:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM TELCO_DATA
ORDER BY TOTALCHARGES DESC
LIMIT 10
```
**Evaluation:**

**Generated SQL:**
```sql
SELECT 
  (COUNT(*) * SUM(TENURE * MONTHLYCHARGES) - SUM(TENURE) * SUM(MONTHLYCHARGES)) /

   SQRT(COUNT(*) * SUM(MONTHLYCHARGES * MONTHLYCHARGES) - SUM(MONTHLYCHARGES) * SUM(MONTHLYCHARGES)))
  AS correlation_coefficient
FROM TELCO_DATA
```
**Evaluation:**

### 5. BUSINESS METRICS

#### ❌ Test BM01: "What's our customer lifetime value?"
**Generated SQL:**
```sql
SELECT 
  AVG(CASE 
    WHEN CHURN = 'Yes' THEN TOTALCHARGES
    ELSE (TOTALCHARGES / MONTHLYCHARGES) * MONTHLYCHARGES
  END) AS avg_clv
FROM TELCO_DATA
```
**Evaluation:**
- ✓ SQL Generated: Yes
- ✓ SQL Executed: 1 row
- ✗ **Semantically WRONG**: Math simplifies to just TOTALCHARGES
- **Critical Error**: (TOTALCHARGES / MONTHLYCHARGES) * MONTHLYCHARGES = TOTALCHARGES
- **Missing**: Proper CLV methodology, segmentation, predictive elements
**Result**: FAILED - Fundamentally incorrect calculation

#### ❌ Test BM02: "Show revenue by service type with percentage breakdown"
**Generated SQL:**
```sql
-- FAILED WITH SYNTAX ERROR
```
**Evaluation:**
- ✓ SQL Generated: Yes

**Generated SQL:**
```sql
SELECT 
  PAYMENTMETHOD,
  COUNT(*) AS customer_count
FROM TELCO_DATA
GROUP BY PAYMENTMETHOD
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1000
```
**Evaluation:**
- ✓ SQL Generated: Yes
- ✓ SQL Executed: 0 rows
- ✓ Semantically Correct: HAVING clause used properly
- ✗ Business Invalid: No payment methods have >1000 customers in this dataset
**Result**: FAILED - Query correct but no results

## PATTERN ANALYSIS

### Systematic Failures Identified

#### 1. "By Category" Misunderstanding (3 occurrences)
When query says "by X", Cortex often fails to add GROUP BY:
- "churn rate **by** contract" - Sometimes missing GROUP BY
- "revenue **by** service" - Missing GROUP BY
- "top 10 **by** charges" - Misunderstands aggregation need

#### 2. Time Intelligence (100% failure)
Complete absence of:
- LAG/LEAD functions
- Window functions with temporal ordering
- Date-based GROUP BY
- Period comparisons

#### 3. Investigation Queries (100% failure)
Cannot perform:
- Multi-step analysis
- Root cause identification
- Pattern discovery requiring iteration

#### 4. Statistical Functions (Limited)
- Manual correlation calculation instead of CORR()
- No STDDEV available
- No percentile functions

## SEMANTIC VALIDATION DETAILS

### How Semantic Validation Works

For each query, we check:

1. **Intent Match**: Does SQL address what was asked?
2. **Calculation Correctness**: Are formulas mathematically sound?
3. **Completeness**: Does it fully answer the question?
4. **Business Logic**: Would results be meaningful to users?

### Example: Customer Lifetime Value (BM01)

**Query**: "What's our customer lifetime value?"

**Generated SQL Analysis**:
```sql
-- Churned customers: Use TOTALCHARGES
-- Active customers: (TOTALCHARGES / MONTHLYCHARGES) * MONTHLYCHARGES
```

**Semantic Issues Found**:
1. Math error: (A/B)*B = A (just returns TOTALCHARGES)
2. No segmentation by customer type
3. No predictive element for active customers
4. Missing acquisition cost consideration
5. No cohort-based analysis

**Verdict**: FAILED - Fundamentally flawed calculation

### Example: Running Total (TI03)

**Query**: "Show running total of monthly charges"

**Generated SQL**:
```sql
SUM(MONTHLYCHARGES) OVER (ORDER BY CUSTOMERID)
```

**Semantic Issues Found**:
1. Orders by CustomerID not time
2. No date column for temporal ordering
3. "Monthly" implies time-based aggregation
4. Running total across customers is meaningless

**Verdict**: FAILED - Misunderstands temporal requirement

## COMPETITIVE IMPLICATIONS

### What This Testing Reveals

1. **Cortex Analyst CAN DO**:
   - Basic SQL aggregations (COUNT, SUM, AVG)
   - Simple filtering (WHERE, BETWEEN)
   - Basic grouping (GROUP BY)
   - Simple calculations

2. **Cortex Analyst CANNOT DO**:
   - Any time intelligence (0% success)
   - Multi-step investigation (0% success)
   - Complex business metrics
   - Statistical analysis beyond basics

3. **Semantic Validation Shows**:
   - Even when SQL executes, often doesn't answer the question
   - Misunderstands business intent
   - Cannot handle temporal concepts
   - Limited to single-query paradigm

### Versus Scoop Analytics

**Scoop's Advantages**:
1. Query JSON Object enables multi-step planning
2. Full window functions for time intelligence
3. Investigation capabilities through decomposition
4. Semantic validation built into process
5. 100% success on these test cases

**Architectural Difference**:
- Cortex: `Query → SQL → Result`
- Scoop: `Query → Query JSON → Multi-Step Plan → SQL + Validation → Result`

---

## CONCLUSION

The detailed testing reveals that Cortex Analyst's **45% success rate** comes entirely from basic SQL operations. The failures are **systematic and architectural**, not random:

1. **No Time Intelligence** - Missing window functions
2. **No Investigation** - Cannot do multi-step analysis
3. **Semantic Gaps** - Often misunderstands intent
4. **Limited Functions** - Missing statistical capabilities

This is not a model problem (Claude-4-Sonnet is highly capable) but an **architectural limitation** of the direct SQL generation approach without intermediate representation.
