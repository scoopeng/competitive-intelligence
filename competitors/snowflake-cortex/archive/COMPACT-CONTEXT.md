# COMPACT CONTEXT: Cortex Testing Complete â†’ Ready for UI Phase

## What We Completed
**73 queries tested** on CORTEX.COMPLETE (the LLM underlying Cortex Analyst)
- Natural language: 0% success
- With table context: 65% execution  
- Investigation: 0% capability
- Scoop patterns: 50% match

## Key Learning for Cortex Analyst UI Testing

### CORTEX.COMPLETE Limitations (Won't be fixed by UI):
1. **No multi-step analysis** - Single query only
2. **No investigation** - Can't answer "why"
3. **No time intelligence** - No period comparisons
4. **No window functions** - No cumulative/running totals
5. **No formula filters** - Can't filter on calculations

### What Cortex Analyst UI Might Help:
1. **Semantic model** - Maps business terms to tables/columns
2. **Context persistence** - Maintains table awareness
3. **Visual interface** - Easier than API calls

## Test Cases for Cortex Analyst UI

### Priority 1: Natural Language (Test if semantic model helps)
```
"How many customers do we have?"
"What's our average revenue?"
"Show me top products"
```

### Priority 2: Investigation (Test if still fails)
```
"Why are sales declining?"
"What drives customer churn?"
"Find patterns in successful accounts"
```

### Priority 3: Advanced Patterns (Test Scoop capabilities)
```
"Month-over-month growth"
"Running total of revenue"
"Percentage of total by region"
```

## Your Streamlit Setup

You have:
- Streamlit app workspace created
- Default demo Python running
- Need to test with Sonnet-4

### Next Steps:
1. Configure semantic model for your test data
2. Run the same 73 queries through UI
3. Document which limitations persist
4. Compare to CORTEX.COMPLETE baseline

## Critical Questions for UI Testing

1. **Does semantic model overcome 0% natural language?**
   - Baseline: Complete failure without context
   - Test: Same 15 queries through UI

2. **Can UI enable any investigation?**
   - Baseline: 0% capability
   - Test: "Why" questions through UI

3. **Does UI add multi-step capability?**
   - Baseline: Single query only
   - Test: Complex analysis requiring multiple steps

## Files to Reference

### Test Suites to Run:
- `/test-scripts/test_natural_language.py` - 15 queries
- `/test-scripts/test_comprehensive_patterns.py` - 20 patterns
- `/test-scripts/test_investigation_capability.py` - Investigation

### Baselines to Compare:
- `/test-results/natural_language_results.json` - 0% baseline
- `/test-results/comprehensive_pattern_results.json` - Pattern results

### Documentation:
- `MASTER-TESTING-SUMMARY.md` - Complete findings
- `CORTEX-ANALYST-TESTING-PLAN.md` - UI testing approach

## Expected Outcomes

Based on CORTEX.COMPLETE testing:

**Will Improve:**
- Natural language understanding (semantic model helps)
- Column name accuracy
- Business term mapping

**Won't Improve:**
- Investigation capability
- Multi-step analysis  
- Time intelligence
- Statistical depth
- Pattern discovery

## The Bottom Line

CORTEX.COMPLETE is a basic SQL generator. Cortex Analyst adds a semantic layer and UI but can't overcome fundamental architectural limitations. Focus testing on whether the UI makes the basic capabilities more accessible, not whether it adds new capabilities.
