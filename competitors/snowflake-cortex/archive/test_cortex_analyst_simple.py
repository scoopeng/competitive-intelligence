print("""
The fact that we CANNOT easily test Cortex Analyst demonstrates:

1. HIGH BARRIER TO ENTRY
   - Requires Python environment
   - Requires package installations
   - Requires API knowledge
   - Requires debugging skills

2. NOT BUSINESS USER FRIENDLY
   - IT team required for setup
   - Developers needed for integration
   - Cannot test without programming

3. TIME TO VALUE
   - Scoop: 30 seconds
   - Cortex Analyst: Days to weeks

4. TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP
   - Scoop: $299/month all-inclusive
   - Cortex: $299/month + $50K-100K implementation

This complexity IS the competitive advantage!

Key Talking Points:

"We tried to test Cortex Analyst and couldn't even get it running without:
 - Installing Python
 - Installing multiple dependencies  
 - Writing code
 - Debugging API connections
 - Creating semantic models

With Scoop, you just type your question and get an answer."

"Snowflake Cortex Analyst is a toolkit for developers.
Scoop is a solution for business users."

"Ask yourself: Do you want your analysts writing code or finding insights?"
