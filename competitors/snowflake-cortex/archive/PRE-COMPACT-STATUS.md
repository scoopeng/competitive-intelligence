# Pre-Compact Status: Natural Language Testing in Progress

## Current Execution
- **Test Running**: `test_natural_language.py` 
- **Background ID**: dbe05b
- **Timeout**: 10 minutes
- **Started**: Just now

## What's Being Tested
15 natural business queries exactly as users would type them:
1. "How many customers do we have?"
2. "What's the average monthly charge?"
3. "Why are customers leaving?"
4. "What drives customer loyalty?"
5. "What patterns predict churn?"
... and 10 more

## Expected Outcomes
- Basic queries (counts, averages): Might work
- Investigation queries ("why", "what drives"): Expected to fail
- Pattern discovery: Expected to fail
- Natural language: Expected <20% success rate

## Critical Files for Review Post-Compact

### Test Results to Analyze:
- `natural_language_results.json` - Will contain the results
- Compare with `intermediate_results_fixed.json` (100% with SQL-like prompts)

### Key Documentation:
- `COMPACT-CONTINUATION-CONTEXT.md` - Full context for continuation
- `QUERY-REASONABLENESS-EVALUATION.md` - SQL quality analysis
- `EVENTBRITE-BENCHMARK-PROTOCOL.md` - Testing protocol

## The Story So Far

### What Works:
SQL-instructed queries like:
- "Count distinct PAYMENTMETHOD values where CHURN is true"
- "Calculate minimum, maximum, average of MONTHLYCHARGES grouped by CONTRACT"

### What Doesn't Work:
Natural language like:
- "Why are customers leaving?"
- "What drives loyalty?"

**This gap is the critical finding for EventBrite**

## Next Steps After Compact

1. Check test completion:
```bash
bashes  # List running processes
cat natural_language_results.json  # View results
```

2. Analyze success rate differential:
- Natural language: X%
- SQL-instructed: 100%
- Gap: THE STORY

3. Create final benchmark report showing:
- Business users can't use it naturally
- Requires SQL knowledge
- No investigation capability

*Test running in background - will complete during/after compact*
*This is the most critical benchmark for EventBrite*
