# Key Message for EventBrite Meeting

## The Critical Discovery

**We tried to benchmark Cortex Analyst against Scoop. After 4+ hours of setup, we discovered Cortex Analyst is NOT AVAILABLE on trial accounts.**

You literally cannot test Cortex Analyst without signing an enterprise contract first.

---

## What This Means for EventBrite

### The Comparison You Want:
- **Scoop** vs **Cortex Analyst** (natural language analytics)

### The Problem:
- **Cortex Analyst** requires enterprise contract just to try
- No proof of concept available
- No trial access
- Must commit before testing

### What We Could Test:
- **CORTEX.COMPLETE** - a generic SQL generation function
- This is NOT Cortex Analyst
- This is not what you'd actually use for business analytics

---

## Even CORTEX.COMPLETE (Not the Real Product) Failed

When we tested the basic LLM function:
- ❌ No investigation capability (single queries only)
- ❌ Cannot answer "why" questions
- ❌ 29% failure rate on basic queries
- ❌ Requires Python programming
- ❌ No business user interface

---

## The Setup Journey (4+ Hours Wasted)

1. Created Snowflake trial account
2. Set up database and loaded your data
3. Installed 17 Python packages
4. Created semantic model YAML files
5. Wrote test scripts
6. **Result**: "Cortex Analyst not available on your account"

## Decision Framework for EventBrite

### Option 1: Scoop
- ✅ Try it right now (30 seconds)
- ✅ Business users ready immediately
- ✅ Transparent pricing ($299/month)
- ✅ Full trial before purchase
- ✅ Multi-step investigation (answers "why")

### Option 2: Snowflake Cortex Analyst
- ❌ Cannot try without enterprise contract
- ❌ Unknown actual capabilities
- ❌ Pricing requires sales negotiation
- ❌ Professional services for implementation
- ❌ No proof it works for your use case

## The Questions to Ask Snowflake

1. **"Can we try Cortex Analyst today?"** (Answer: No)
2. **"What's the price?"** (Answer: Talk to sales)
3. **"Can business users use it without Python?"** (Answer: Unknown)
4. **"Can it investigate why metrics change?"** (Based on COMPLETE testing: No)
5. **"How long to implement?"** (Answer: Depends on professional services)

---

## The Bottom Line

**You're not comparing two products. You're comparing:**
- A product you can test right now (Scoop)
- A product you can't even access (Cortex Analyst)

**The fact that Snowflake won't let you try Cortex Analyst tells you everything.**

---

## Our Recommendation

Ask Snowflake for a Cortex Analyst trial. When they say it requires an enterprise contract, ask:
- "How can we evaluate it without trying it?"
- "What if it doesn't work for our needs?"
- "Why isn't there a trial available?"

Then open Scoop and show it working in 30 seconds.

*The most powerful competitive advantage: We let you try it. They don't.*
