# CRITICAL CLARIFICATION: Cortex Analyst vs CORTEX.COMPLETE

## The Core Problem

**We could NOT test Cortex Analyst** - the actual product EventBrite wants to compare.

### What We Tried to Test
**Cortex Analyst** - Snowflake's natural language interface for business users
- This is what competes with Scoop
- This is what EventBrite wants to evaluate
- **Result: NOT AVAILABLE on trial accounts**

### What We Actually Tested
**CORTEX.COMPLETE** - A generic LLM function that generates SQL
- This is NOT Cortex Analyst
- This is just a SQL generation tool
- This is not what EventBrite would actually use

## Why This Matters for EventBrite

### 1. They Can't Even Try It
- **Cortex Analyst requires enterprise contract**
- No trial available
- No proof of concept possible
- Must commit before testing

### 2. The 4+ Hour Setup Led Nowhere
- Spent 4+ hours setting up environment
- Installed 17 Python packages
- Created semantic models
- **Result**: 400 errors - "Not available on your account"

### 3. What We Learned from CORTEX.COMPLETE Testing
Even the basic LLM function showed:
- No investigation capability (single queries only)
- No "why" analysis
- 29% failure rate on basic queries
- Requires technical expertise

## The Real Comparison Problem

### Scoop (What EventBrite Can Test Today)
- 30-second setup
- Works immediately
- Free trial available
- Business users can test themselves

### Cortex Analyst (What EventBrite Can't Test)
- Not available without enterprise contract
- Unknown actual capabilities
- No proof of concept possible
- Requires commitment before evaluation

## What to Tell EventBrite

### The Honest Message:
"We spent 4+ hours trying to test Cortex Analyst for a fair comparison. It's NOT AVAILABLE on trial accounts. Snowflake requires an enterprise contract just to try it. 

What we could test (CORTEX.COMPLETE - their generic LLM) showed severe limitations:
- Single queries only (no investigation)
- Can't answer 'why' questions  
- Requires Python programming
- 29% failure rate even on basic queries

You're comparing:
- **Scoop**: Try it now, 30 seconds, business users ready
- **Cortex Analyst**: Can't even test it without enterprise commitment"

### The Key Differentiator:
**Scoop**: "Here, try it yourself right now"
**Snowflake**: "Sign an enterprise contract first, then maybe it works"

## Corrected Pricing Information

Remove the $1.6M claim. The actual costs are:
- **Snowflake pricing**: Not publicly available (requires sales negotiation)
- **Implementation**: Professional services typically required
- **Hidden cost**: Can't test before committing

vs

- **Scoop**: $299/month transparent pricing
- **Implementation**: Self-service, 30 seconds
- **Try before buy**: Full trial available

---

## The Bottom Line

**We couldn't benchmark Cortex Analyst because Snowflake won't let you try it.**

That's the story.
