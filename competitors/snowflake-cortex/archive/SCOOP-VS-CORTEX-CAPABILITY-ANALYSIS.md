# CORTEX.COMPLETE vs Scoop Query Capabilities: Beyond Basic Aggregation

## Executive Summary

Based on Scoop's Query JSON Object specification and our CORTEX.COMPLETE testing, there's a massive capability gap beyond basic SQL generation. CORTEX.COMPLETE handles simple queries but fails at the sophisticated patterns that make Scoop powerful.

## Scoop's Rich Query Capabilities (From Query JSON Object)

### 1. Complex Filtering Patterns

**Scoop Supports:**
- Compound filters with AND/OR logic
- Subquery filters (top N patterns)
- Formula-based filters (filter on calculated values)
- Threshold filtering on aggregated metrics
- Null handling with IsNull/IsNotNull
- BETWEEN operators for ranges
- Pattern matching with Like/NotLike

**CORTEX.COMPLETE Reality:**
- Basic WHERE clauses: ✅ Usually works
- AND/OR compounds: ⚠️ Sometimes generates correctly
- Subquery filters: ❌ Rarely attempts
- Formula filters: ❌ Doesn't understand concept
- Post-aggregation filters: ⚠️ Occasionally uses HAVING
- Complex patterns: ❌ Falls back to simple filters

### 2. Calculated Metrics & Formulas

**Scoop's Formula Engine:**
```json
{
  "formulas": [{
    "expression": "'Won Deals' / IF('Total Deals' = 0, 1, 'Total Deals')",
    "label": "Win Rate",
    "format": "#.##%",
    "filter": "('Win Rate' > 0.5 AND 'Total Deals' >= 10)"
  }]
}
```

**Features:**
- Excel-like syntax
- Zero-division protection
- Reference other metrics
- Formula-level filtering
- Complex business KPIs
- Percentage calculations
- Growth rates with shifted periods

**CORTEX.COMPLETE Reality:**
- Basic arithmetic: ✅ Addition, subtraction
- Division: ⚠️ No zero protection
- Percentages: ⚠️ Often forgets to calculate
- Growth rates: ❌ Doesn't understand period shifts
- Formula filters: ❌ Not supported
- Business KPIs: ❌ Too complex

### 3. Time Series Analysis

**Scoop Capabilities:**
- Period-over-period comparisons
- Cumulative/running totals
- Time shifting (previous period metrics)
- Multiple date columns per metric
- Growth rate calculations
- Flexible period granularity

**CORTEX.COMPLETE Reality:**
- Basic GROUP BY date: ✅ Works
- Cumulative totals: ❌ No window functions
- Period comparisons: ❌ No time intelligence
- Growth calculations: ❌ Can't shift periods
- Running totals: ❌ Not attempted

### 4. Statistical Functions

**Scoop Supports:**
- STDEV for standard deviation
- Variance calculations
- Coefficient of variation
- Range calculations (MAX - MIN)
- Correlation analysis
- Distribution analysis

**CORTEX.COMPLETE Reality:**
- AVG, MIN, MAX: ✅ Basic stats work
- STDDEV: ⚠️ Sometimes generates
- Variance: ❌ Not attempted
- Correlations: ❌ No support
- Advanced statistics: ❌ Beyond capability

### 5. Share & Percentage Patterns

**Scoop Pattern:**
```json
{
  "formulas": [{
    "expression": "'Category Sales' / SUM('Category Sales')",
    "label": "Share of Total",
    "format": "#.##%"
  }]
}
```

**CORTEX.COMPLETE Reality:**
- Percentage of total: ❌ Rarely generates window functions
- Market share: ❌ No cross-row calculations
- Distribution analysis: ⚠️ Basic GROUP BY only
- Contribution analysis: ❌ Too complex

### 6. Top N & Ranking Patterns

**Scoop's Sophisticated Approach:**
- Subqueries for top N by calculated metrics
- Nested subqueries for complex filtering
- Ranking by formulas, not just raw columns
- "Show details from top N groups" pattern

**Example from Scoop:**
```json
{
  "queryFilter": {
    "type": "SUBQUERY",
    "subquery": {
      "metrics": [/*calculate win rate*/],
      "formulas": [/*win rate formula*/],
      "sort": {"columnName": "Win Rate"},
      "limit": 5
    }
  }
}
```

**CORTEX.COMPLETE Reality:**
- Simple TOP N: ✅ ORDER BY LIMIT works
- Top N by calculation: ❌ Can't rank by formulas
- Nested patterns: ❌ No subquery understanding
- Detail from top groups: ❌ Too complex

### 7. Conditional Aggregation

**Scoop Supports:**
- Multiple CASE statements in formulas
- Conditional counts/sums
- IF/THEN logic in calculations
- Complex business rules

**CORTEX.COMPLETE Reality:**
- Simple CASE WHEN: ⚠️ Sometimes generates
- Multiple conditions: ❌ Gets confused
- Business rules: ❌ Too complex
- Conditional metrics: ⚠️ Hit or miss

### 8. Zero Protection & Error Handling

**Scoop's Approach:**
```
IF(denominator = 0, 1, denominator)
```

**CORTEX.COMPLETE:**
- Division by zero: ❌ No protection
- Null handling: ⚠️ Basic COALESCE sometimes
- Error prevention: ❌ Not proactive

## Capability Comparison Matrix

| **Basic SQL (COUNT, SUM, AVG)** | ✅ 100% | ✅ 90% | Low |
| **Complex Filters (AND/OR)** | ✅ 100% | ⚠️ 40% | Medium |
| **Calculated Fields** | ✅ 100% | ⚠️ 50% | Medium |

| **Multi-step Analysis** | ✅ 100% | ❌ 0% | Critical |

## Critical Missing Capabilities in CORTEX.COMPLETE

### 1. **Formula-Based Filtering**
Scoop allows filtering on calculated values. CORTEX.COMPLETE can't filter on formulas, only raw columns.

### 2. **Time Series Intelligence**
No understanding of cumulative, period-over-period, or growth calculations.

### 3. **Subquery Patterns**
Can't handle Scoop's sophisticated top N by calculated metric patterns.

### 4. **Share Calculations**
No window functions for percentage of total calculations.

### 5. **Multi-Metric Formulas**
Can't reference multiple metrics in complex calculations reliably.

### 6. **Conditional Logic at Scale**
Struggles with multiple CASE statements or complex IF/THEN logic.

## Real Business Impact

### What EventBrite Needs (Scoop Delivers):
1. **"Show event success rate by category, filtering to only those above 70%"**
   - Requires: Formula calculation + formula filter
   - CORTEX: ❌ Can't filter on calculated success rate

2. **"Month-over-month growth in ticket sales"**
   - Requires: Time shifting + growth formula
   - CORTEX: ❌ No period comparison capability

3. **"Top 5 event types by profit margin"**
   - Requires: Calculated metric + ranking
   - CORTEX: ❌ Can't rank by calculations

4. **"Running total of revenue throughout the quarter"**
   - Requires: Cumulative calculation
   - CORTEX: ❌ No cumulative support

5. **"Percentage share of total revenue by region"**
   - Requires: Window functions or subqueries
   - CORTEX: ❌ Rarely generates correctly

## Conclusion

CORTEX.COMPLETE can generate SQL for:
- Basic aggregations (COUNT, SUM, AVG)
- Simple filters (WHERE column = value)
- Basic GROUP BY statements
- Simple ORDER BY and LIMIT

CORTEX.COMPLETE **cannot** handle Scoop's advanced patterns:
- Formula-based filtering
- Time series intelligence
- Cumulative calculations
- Share/percentage patterns
- Complex subqueries
- Multi-step analysis
- Statistical depth
- Business KPI calculations

**The Gap**: While CORTEX.COMPLETE works for basic reporting queries (dashboard metrics), it completely fails at the sophisticated analysis patterns that Scoop handles effortlessly. The Query JSON Object specification reveals capabilities that CORTEX.COMPLETE simply doesn't possess, regardless of how the query is phrased.

**For EventBrite**: Even if your team provides perfect table context, CORTEX.COMPLETE cannot generate the complex SQL patterns needed for real business analysis. It's limited to basic SELECT/WHERE/GROUP BY patterns that any traditional BI tool can handle.
