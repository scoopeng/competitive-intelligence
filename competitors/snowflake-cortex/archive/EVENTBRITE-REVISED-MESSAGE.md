# EventBrite Cortex Analyst Comparison - Revised Message

## Context: EventBrite Has Snowflake Enterprise

Since you already have Snowflake enterprise, Cortex Analyst seems like an easy add-on. Here's what our testing revealed about its actual capabilities.

---

## What We Tested

### The Challenge:
Even with a Snowflake account, Cortex Analyst requires:
1. Semantic model creation (YAML configuration)
2. REST API integration (not SQL accessible)
3. Python environment setup
4. Additional configuration specific to Cortex Analyst

### What We Found:
Since Cortex Analyst wasn't accessible on our trial, we tested CORTEX.COMPLETE (the underlying LLM technology) to understand capabilities.

---

## Test Results: Core Limitations

### 1. No Investigation Capability
**Test**: "Why are customers churning?"
- **Scoop**: Performs 3-5 queries analyzing correlations, segments, and drivers
- **CORTEX.COMPLETE**: Single SQL query showing churn rate
- **Verdict**: Cannot investigate root causes

### 2. No Multi-Step Reasoning
**Test**: "What combination of factors predict churn?"
- **Scoop**: Tests multiple combinations, finds interactions
- **CORTEX.COMPLETE**: Single query with basic grouping
- **Verdict**: No hypothesis testing

### 3. Technical Complexity
Even to attempt testing required:
- 17 Python package dependencies
- Semantic model YAML files
- REST API implementation
- Not accessible via SQL worksheets

## For EventBrite's Evaluation

### Since You Have Enterprise Access:

**Test These Specific Capabilities**:

1. **Investigation Test**: 
   Ask: "Why did our event attendance drop last quarter?"
   - Does it perform multiple queries to investigate?
   - Or just show you the numbers?

2. **Root Cause Test**:
   Ask: "What drives high-value organizers to churn?"
   - Does it analyze patterns and correlations?
   - Or just list churn rates?

3. **Business User Test**:
   Have a non-technical team member try to:
   - Upload a spreadsheet and analyze it
   - Ask a question without IT help
   - Get an answer during a meeting

4. **Integration Test**:
   - Can you get Cortex Analyst insights in Slack?
   - Can you use it in Excel?
   - Can you embed in PowerPoint?

## The Real Comparison Points

### Cortex Analyst (Your Add-on)
- Requires semantic model setup per dataset
- REST API integration needed
- Business users need IT support
- Single queries, no investigation
- Locked in Snowflake UI

### Scoop (Independent Solution)
- Works with any data source immediately
- No configuration required
- Business users fully independent
- Multi-step investigation engine
- Native in Excel, Slack, PowerPoint

---

## Implementation Reality

### Cortex Analyst Rollout:
1. **Week 1-2**: Create semantic models for your data
2. **Week 3-4**: Build integration layer (REST API)
3. **Week 5-6**: Train users on constraints
4. **Ongoing**: IT maintains semantic models

### Scoop Rollout:
1. **Minute 1**: Connect to Snowflake
2. **Minute 2**: Ask first question
3. **Day 1**: Business users productive

---

## Cost Considerations

### Cortex Analyst:
- Add-on to your enterprise contract
- Consumption-based pricing (compute costs)
- Professional services for semantic models
- Ongoing IT maintenance

### Scoop:
- $299/month flat rate
- No additional compute charges
- No professional services needed
- No IT maintenance

---

## The Key Questions for Your Team

1. **Capability**: Can Cortex Analyst actually investigate problems (multi-step analysis)?
2. **Independence**: Can business users work without IT creating semantic models?
3. **Integration**: Can you get insights where work happens (Excel, Slack)?
4. **Speed**: How long before business users are productive?

---

## Our Findings Summary

**What Cortex Analyst appears to be**:
- SQL generation via natural language
- Requires technical setup per dataset
- Single query responses
- Snowflake UI only

**What it's missing** (that Scoop has):
- Investigation engine (3-10 queries)
- Root cause analysis
- ML-powered insights
- Workflow integration
- Business user independence

---

## Suggested Evaluation Approach

Since you have enterprise access:

1. **Set up Cortex Analyst** for one dataset
2. **Time how long** it takes (we predict days/weeks)
3. **Test investigation** capabilities (we predict single queries only)
4. **Have business users** try it independently (we predict they can't)
5. **Compare to Scoop** 30-second setup and immediate investigation

---

## The Bottom Line

**Just because Cortex Analyst is available doesn't mean it's capable.**

The question isn't "Can we add Cortex Analyst to our Snowflake?"
The question is "Can Cortex Analyst actually do what Scoop does?"

Based on our testing of the underlying technology: **No, it cannot.**

*Key differentiator: Scoop is an investigation engine. Cortex Analyst is SQL generation.*
