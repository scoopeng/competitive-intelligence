# CRITICAL CONTEXT FOR POST-COMPACT CONTINUATION

## Current Status
**Date**: January 2025
**Task**: Complete natural language benchmark of CORTEX.COMPLETE with REAL business user queries
**Why Critical**: EventBrite needs to know actual success rate with queries their sales team would type

---

## Key Context

### What We're Testing
**CORTEX.COMPLETE** - The underlying LLM for Cortex Analyst
- NOT Cortex Analyst itself (not available on trial)
- EventBrite has enterprise, can test Cortex Analyst UI separately
- We need baseline of what the LLM can handle with natural language

### Critical Discovery So Far
- With SQL-like prompts: 100% success
- With natural language: Unknown (test timed out)
- **This difference is THE key finding**

### Database Connection
```python
account='toajlpe-nfb33705'
user='bradscoop'
password='D6c2BmtJWPy3dM7'
warehouse='COMPUTE_WH'
database='SCOOP_BENCHMARK'
schema='TEST_DATA'
# Table: TELCO_DATA (7,043 rows)
```

### Test File Created
`test_natural_language.py` - Contains 15 natural business queries like:
- "How many customers do we have?"
- "Why are customers leaving?"
- "What drives customer loyalty?"
- "What patterns predict churn?"

---

## What Needs to Be Completed

### 1. Run Natural Language Test with Extended Timeout
```bash
python3 test_natural_language.py
# Use timeout=600000 (10 minutes) or run_in_background=True
```

### 2. Document Results
Compare success rates:
- Natural language queries (what users type)
- SQL-instructed queries (what worked before)
- Gap analysis

### 3. Create Final Benchmark Summary
- Natural language success rate
- Investigation capability (likely 0%)
- Business user readiness assessment

---

## Files to Review Post-Compact

### Already Created Tests
- `test_complete_comparison.py` - Original 7 queries (71% success)
- `test_intermediate_fixed.py` - SQL-like prompts (100% success)
- `test_natural_language.py` - Natural prompts (NEEDS COMPLETION)

### Documentation
- `QUERY-REASONABLENESS-EVALUATION.md` - Analysis of SQL quality
- `EVENTBRITE-BENCHMARK-PROTOCOL.md` - How EventBrite can test
- `HOW-TO-ACTUALLY-TEST-CORTEX-ANALYST.md` - UI testing guide

---

## Critical Questions to Answer

1. **What % of natural language queries work?**
   - Hypothesis: <20% based on initial results
   - Need actual data

2. **Do investigation queries work at all?**
   - "Why" questions
   - "What drives" questions
   - Pattern discovery

3. **Business User Readiness**
   - Can sales people use it without training?
   - Do they need to learn SQL terminology?

---

## The Key Comparison

### What Business Users Type:
"Why are customers leaving?"
"What drives customer loyalty?"
"Show me churn rate by contract type"

### What Actually Works:
"SELECT CONTRACT, COUNT(*) WHERE CHURN=true GROUP BY CONTRACT"
"Count distinct PAYMENTMETHOD values where CHURN is true"

**This gap IS the story for EventBrite**

---

## Next Steps After Compact

1. **IMMEDIATELY** run test_natural_language.py with extended timeout:
```python
# Add to Bash command:
timeout=600000  # 10 minutes
# OR
run_in_background=True
```

2. Analyze results:
   - Count successes/failures
   - Categorize failure types
   - Compare to SQL-instructed success

3. Create final deliverable:
   - Side-by-side comparison
   - Business impact assessment
   - Recommendation for EventBrite

## Remember

**EventBrite's Context**:
- They have enterprise Snowflake
- Cortex Analyst is "mildly incremental" cost
- They need to know if it actually works with natural language
- Their users are sales people, not data analysts

**Our Finding So Far**:
- Requires SQL-like language to work
- Natural language likely fails
- No investigation capability regardless

*This is the critical test - don't shortcut it*
*Run with proper timeout*
*Document everything*
