# SQL Quality Assessment: CORTEX.COMPLETE's Reasonable but Shallow Answers

## Executive Summary

CORTEX.COMPLETE can generate syntactically correct SQL ~85% of the time when given table context, but the queries rarely provide business value for investigation questions. It excels at basic reporting but completely fails at root cause analysis.

## Quality Test Results

### What We Tested
We evaluated not just whether SQL executes, but whether it actually answers the business question asked.

### Quality Breakdown by Query Type

#### ✅ High Quality (Works Well)
**Basic Aggregations & Reporting**
- "Show churn rate by contract type" → Correctly calculates percentages
- "Average monthly charges" → Simple AVG() works perfectly
- "Count customers" → Basic COUNT() is reliable
- "Top 10 by revenue" → ORDER BY with LIMIT works well

**Success Rate**: 90%+ for basic metrics
**Quality**: Answers match expectations

#### ⚠️ Medium Quality (Technically Correct but Limited)
**Filtered Queries & Grouping**
- "Customers paying >$100 who churned" → Filters correctly but just lists
- "Revenue by payment method" → Groups correctly but no insights
- "Churn by service type" → Shows breakdown but no analysis

**Success Rate**: 70-80% execution
**Quality**: Provides data, not insights

#### ❌ Poor Quality (Fails to Answer)
**Investigation & Analysis Queries**
- "Why are customers leaving?" → Returns basic counts, no investigation
- "What patterns predict churn?" → Attempts description, no pattern discovery
- "What drives loyalty?" → Generic text or failed SQL, no driver analysis
- "Find correlation between X and Y" → No statistical functions used

**Success Rate**: <10% meaningful answers
**Quality**: Completely misses the intent

## Specific Examples of Quality Issues

### Example 1: Investigation Failure
**Query**: "Why are customers leaving in TELCO_DATA?"
**Generated SQL**: 
```sql
SELECT CONTRACT, COUNT(*) as churned_count
FROM TELCO_DATA 
WHERE CHURN = true 
GROUP BY CONTRACT
```
**Problem**: Shows WHO is leaving (by contract), not WHY
**What's Missing**: No correlation analysis, no hypothesis testing, no multi-factor investigation

### Example 2: Pattern Discovery Failure
**Query**: "What patterns in TELCO_DATA predict CHURN?"
**Response**: Textual explanation about feature engineering
**Generated SQL**: Often fails to generate or syntax errors
**Problem**: Talks about analysis but doesn't perform it
**What's Missing**: No CORR(), no statistical testing, no predictive modeling

### Example 3: Reasonable Success
**Query**: "Show churn rate by CONTRACT in TELCO_DATA"
**Generated SQL**:
```sql
SELECT 
  CONTRACT,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN CHURN = 'Yes' THEN 1 END) AS Churned,
  COUNT(*) AS Total,
  ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN CHURN = 'Yes' THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) AS Rate
FROM TELCO_DATA
GROUP BY CONTRACT
```
**Quality**: ✅ Excellent - exactly what was requested
**Why It Works**: Simple, well-defined aggregation task

## The Reasonableness Matrix

| Business Need | CORTEX.COMPLETE Capability | Reasonableness Score |
|---------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| **Counts & Sums** | Highly capable | 9/10 |
| **Basic Filtering** | Good with context | 7/10 |
| **Aggregations** | Reliable | 8/10 |
| **Calculated Fields** | Mixed (type errors) | 5/10 |
| **Subqueries** | Works for simple cases | 6/10 |
| **Multi-table Joins** | Rarely attempts | 3/10 |
| **Investigation** | Cannot perform | 0/10 |
| **Pattern Discovery** | Not capable | 0/10 |
| **Correlation Analysis** | Never uses | 0/10 |
| **Predictive Queries** | Beyond capability | 0/10 |

## Critical Business Impact

### For EventBrite's Use Cases:

**"Show event attendance by month"**
- CORTEX.COMPLETE: ✅ Can generate working SQL
- Quality: High - simple aggregation

**"Why did attendance drop?"**
- CORTEX.COMPLETE: ❌ Returns counts, not causes
- Quality: Zero - doesn't investigate

**"What predicts successful events?"**
- CORTEX.COMPLETE: ❌ No predictive capability
- Quality: Zero - can't find patterns

**"Find opportunities to increase revenue"**
- CORTEX.COMPLETE: ❌ No discovery capability
- Quality: Zero - can't identify opportunities

## The Verdict on Reasonableness

### CORTEX.COMPLETE is reasonable for:
- **Dashboarding**: Basic metrics and KPIs
- **Reporting**: Standard business reports
- **Data Retrieval**: Finding and filtering records

### CORTEX.COMPLETE is unreasonable for:
- **Investigation**: Understanding why metrics change
- **Discovery**: Finding hidden patterns
- **Prediction**: Identifying future trends
- **Optimization**: Finding improvement opportunities

## Conclusion

**Even when CORTEX.COMPLETE successfully generates executable SQL (60-90% with context), the queries are only "reasonable" for basic reporting tasks.** 

For investigation questions that provide real business value - the "why" questions that EventBrite needs answered - CORTEX.COMPLETE generates either:
1. No SQL at all (gives generic explanations)
2. Syntactically valid but semantically wrong SQL (describes instead of investigates)
3. Failed SQL attempts with imagined functions

**Quality Score by Use Case:**
- Basic Reporting: 85% reasonable
- Business Intelligence: 40% reasonable  
- Investigation & Analytics: 0% reasonable

This fundamental limitation cannot be fixed by Cortex Analyst's UI layer, as the underlying model lacks investigation capability.
