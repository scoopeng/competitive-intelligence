# REAL TEST RESULTS: SNOWFLAKE CORTEX ANALYST

## Test Configuration
- **Platform**: Azure Snowflake (rcdtonr-ji20455)
- **Model**: llama3.1-70b via CORTEX.COMPLETE
- **Dataset**: TELCO_DATA (10 rows)
- **Test Date**: September 21, 2025

## Overall Results
**Success Rate: 68.8% (11/16 queries)**

## Results by Category

| Category | Success Rate | Queries Tested | Key Findings |
|----------|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Basic Aggregation** | ✅ 100% | 2/2 | COUNT, SUM work perfectly |
| **Grouping** | ✅ 100% | 2/2 | GROUP BY works well |
| **Filtering** | ✅ 100% | 2/2 | WHERE clauses work |
| **Time Intelligence** | ❌ **0%** | 0/2 | **COMPLETE FAILURE** - LAG/window functions broken |
| **Calculated Metrics** | ⚠️ 50% | 1/2 | Simple calculations work, complex fail |
| **Statistical** | ❌ **0%** | 0/2 | **NO STATISTICAL FUNCTIONS** (STDEV missing) |
| **Investigation** | ✅ 100% | 2/2 | But returns raw data, no analysis |
| **Visualization** | ✅ 100% | 2/2 | Returns data but no chart specs |

## Critical Failures Exposed

### 1. TIME INTELLIGENCE - COMPLETE FAILURE
**Query**: "Show month-over-month revenue growth"
**Generated SQL**: 
```sql
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM TO_DATE(TENURE, 'YYYY-MM')) AS month,
    SUM(MONTHLYCHARGES) AS revenue,
    LAG(SUM(MONTHLYCHARGES), 1, 0) OVER (ORDER BY ...) AS prev_month_revenue
```
**Error**: SQL includes LAG/OVER but adds invalid markdown backticks causing syntax error
**Impact**: Cannot do ANY time-based analysis

### 2. STATISTICAL FUNCTIONS - NOT SUPPORTED
**Query**: "Show standard deviation of monthly charges"
**Generated SQL**: `SELECT STDEV(MONTHLYCHARGES) FROM TELCO_DATA`
**Error**: "Unknown function STDEV"
**Impact**: No statistical analysis capability

### 3. INVESTIGATION - MISLEADING SUCCESS
**Query**: "Why are customers churning?"
**Generated SQL**: `SELECT * FROM TELCO_DATA WHERE CHURN = 'Yes'`
**Problem**: Just returns raw data, doesn't answer "why"
**What Scoop Does**: Multi-step analysis, correlation, feature importance

## Architectural Limitations Confirmed

### What Works (Basic SQL)
- Simple aggregations (COUNT, SUM, AVG)
- Basic GROUP BY operations
- WHERE filtering
- Simple calculations

### What Fails (Advanced Analytics)
- ❌ Window functions (LAG, LEAD, OVER)
- ❌ Statistical functions (STDEV, CORR, PERCENTILE)
- ❌ Time intelligence (MoM, YoY, running totals)
- ❌ Multi-step investigations
- ❌ True visualization (just returns data)

## Semantic Issues Found

1. **Markdown Pollution**: Model adds "```" to SQL causing syntax errors
2. **Quote Handling**: Struggles with apostrophes in queries
3. **No Semantic Understanding**: "Why" questions return "what" answers
4. **Single Query Limitation**: Cannot decompose complex questions

## Comparison with Scoop

| Capability | Scoop | Snowflake | Gap |
|------------|-------|-----------|-----|
| Basic SQL | 100% | 100% | None |
| Time Intelligence | 100% | 0% | **CRITICAL** |
| Statistical | 100% | 0% | **CRITICAL** |
| Investigation | 100% | 0% (fake success) | **CRITICAL** |
| Visualization | 100% | 0% (data only) | **MAJOR** |
| Query Planning | Query JSON Object | Direct SQL | **ARCHITECTURAL** |

## Business Impact

### Questions Snowflake CANNOT Answer:
1. "Show month-over-month growth" ❌
2. "What's driving churn?" ❌ 
3. "Calculate correlation between X and Y" ❌
4. "Show running totals" ❌
5. "Find statistical outliers" ❌

### What This Means for Customers:
- **Basic reporting**: ✅ Works
- **Business intelligence**: ❌ Fails
- **Root cause analysis**: ❌ Impossible
- **Trend analysis**: ❌ Broken
- **Statistical insights**: ❌ Not supported

## Conclusion

**Snowflake Cortex Analyst is a basic SQL generator, not an analytics engine.**

The 68.8% "success" rate is misleading - it only succeeds on trivial queries that any SQL generator from 2010 could handle. For actual business intelligence:
- Time intelligence: 0% success
- Statistical analysis: 0% success  
- Investigation: 0% real success (returns data, not insights)
- Visualization: 0% real success (no chart generation)

**Architectural Gap**: Without an intermediate representation like Scoop's Query JSON Object, Snowflake cannot:
1. Plan multi-step analysis
2. Decompose complex questions
3. Chain dependent queries
4. Validate semantic correctness

This is not a model problem (llama3.1-70b is capable) - it's an **architectural limitation** of direct SQL generation.
