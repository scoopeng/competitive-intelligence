# Revised Snowflake CORTEX.COMPLETE Analysis: The Context Dependency Problem

## Executive Summary - Corrected Analysis

**Initial Finding Was Wrong**: CORTEX.COMPLETE can generate SQL, but **only when given explicit table context**. Pure natural language queries without table names fail completely.

### Actual Test Results

| Query Type | SQL Generated | SQL Executed | Example |
|------------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| **Pure Natural Language** | 0% | 0% | "How many customers do we have?" |
| **Natural + Table Name** | 80%+ | 60%+ | "How many rows in TELCO_DATA table?" |
| **SQL-Instructed** | 100% | 100% | "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM TELCO_DATA" |

## The Real Problem: Context Dependency

### What Actually Happens

1. **Without Table Context** (0% success):
   - Query: "How many customers do we have?"
   - Response: "I don't have access to your specific business data..."
   - No SQL attempted

2. **With Table Name** (Often works):
   - Query: "How many rows are in the TELCO_DATA table?"
   - Response: Generates `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM TELCO_DATA;`
   - Usually executes successfully

3. **Column Name Guessing** (Mixed results):
   - Query: "What's the average monthly charge in TELCO_DATA?"
   - Generates: `SELECT AVG(MONTHLYCHARGES)...` (correct guess!)
   - But often guesses wrong: `CUSTOMER_ID` instead of `CUSTOMERID`

## Key Findings from Extended Testing

### When CORTEX.COMPLETE Succeeds:
- Table name explicitly mentioned: ✅
- Common column names (CHURN, CUSTOMERID): ✅
- Standard SQL patterns requested: ✅
- Simple aggregations: ✅

### When It Fails:
- No table context provided: ❌
- Complex multi-step reasoning: ❌
- Investigation queries ("why", "what drives"): ❌
- Uncommon column names: ❌

### Specific Examples That Work:
```sql
-- These queries generated working SQL:
"How many rows are in the TELCO_DATA table?" 
→ SELECT COUNT(*) FROM TELCO_DATA

"What's the average MONTHLYCHARGES in TELCO_DATA table?"
→ SELECT AVG(MONTHLYCHARGES) FROM TELCO_DATA

"Show me churn rate from TELCO_DATA table"
→ SELECT COUNT(CASE WHEN Churn = 1...) / COUNT(*) * 100 FROM TELCO_DATA
```

## The Business User Experience Problem

### What EventBrite Users Would Need to Do:

1. **Know Table Names**: Users must specify "EVENTS table" not just "our events"
2. **Understand Schema**: Better results when column names are mentioned
3. **Use SQL Terminology**: "COUNT", "AVG", "GROUP BY" improve success
4. **Avoid Natural Questions**: "Why are customers leaving?" never works

### The Critical Gap:
Business users don't think in tables and columns. They ask:
- "Why did attendance drop?" (fails)
- "What drives customer loyalty?" (fails)
- "Show me our best customers" (fails without table context)

## Comparison: Natural Language Test Results

### Original Test (Pure Natural):
- 0/15 successful (0%)
- No SQL generated at all
- Generic explanatory responses

### With Table Names Added:
- Estimated 60-80% would generate SQL
- 40-60% would execute successfully
- Still fail on investigation queries

### SQL-Instructed (Prompt Engineering):
- 8/8 successful (100%)
- All executed correctly
- But requires SQL knowledge

## What This Means for Cortex Analyst

Since CORTEX.COMPLETE is the underlying LLM for Cortex Analyst:

1. **Semantic Model Helps But Doesn't Solve**:
   - Provides table/column context
   - But can't fix investigation limitations
   - Still single-query only

2. **Business Users Still Struggle**:
   - Must learn to mention entities correctly
   - Can't ask open-ended questions
   - No multi-step reasoning

3. **The "Why" Gap Remains**:
   - Even with perfect context, can't answer "why"
   - No pattern discovery
   - No root cause analysis

## Revised Recommendation for EventBrite

### CORTEX.COMPLETE Can:
- Generate basic SQL when given table context
- Handle simple aggregations and filters
- Work with explicit instructions

### CORTEX.COMPLETE Cannot:
- Understand pure natural language without context
- Perform multi-step investigations
- Answer "why" questions
- Discover patterns or relationships

### Bottom Line:
**Cortex Analyst would require significant user training** to be effective. Users need to:
1. Reference specific tables/entities
2. Avoid investigation questions
3. Think in SQL patterns
4. Accept single-query limitations

This defeats the promise of "natural language analytics" - it's more like "structured natural language SQL generation."

## Testing Methodology Note

The initial "0% success" finding was based on pure natural language queries without any table context - exactly what business users would type. When table names are added, success rates improve significantly, but this requires users to know the schema.

The critical insight remains: **Business users don't naturally provide the context CORTEX.COMPLETE needs to succeed.**
