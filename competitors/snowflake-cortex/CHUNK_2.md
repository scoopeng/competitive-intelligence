# CHUNK 2: Technical Reality & Competitive Context (30-35 minutes)

## YOUR MISSION
Document technical limitations with quantified data and position in competitive landscape.

## PHASE 2A: Technical Performance Analysis (12-15 minutes)

### Performance Quantification
1. "Snowflake Cortex slow performance response time seconds query"
2. "Snowflake Cortex memory requirements GB RAM crashes"
3. "Snowflake Cortex concurrent users limit scalability testing"
4. "Snowflake Cortex database timeout connection errors"
5. "Snowflake Cortex uptime downtime SLA breach outage"

**Goal**: Get specific numbers - response times, memory needs, user limits, uptime stats

### Integration Reality Check
6. "Snowflake Cortex API rate limits throttling developers"
7. "Snowflake Cortex SSO integration broken SAML authentication"
8. "Snowflake Cortex mobile app terrible performance user"
9. "Snowflake Cortex embedding iframe security CSP issues"
10. "Snowflake Cortex REST API documentation incomplete missing"

**Focus**: Real developer pain points, integration failures, technical debt

## PHASE 2B: Competitive Positioning Research (10-12 minutes)

### Direct Competitive Intelligence
11. "Snowflake Cortex vs Tableau why customers switch"
12. "Snowflake Cortex vs ThoughtSpot RFP evaluation lost deal"
13. "Snowflake Cortex vs Qlik comparison customers choose alternative"
14. "Snowflake Cortex losing market share declining adoption 2024 2025"

### Analyst & Market Intelligence
15. "Snowflake Cortex Gartner customers complain disappointed"
16. "Snowflake Cortex Forrester critical assessment limitations"
17. "Snowflake Cortex analyst report customer feedback negative"

**Goal**: Position in market context, understand competitive losses

## PHASE 2C: Economic Impact Deep Dive (8-10 minutes)

### Total Cost of Ownership Reality
18. "Snowflake Cortex hidden costs professional services implementation"
19. "Snowflake Cortex training required weeks months learning curve"
20. "Snowflake Cortex consultant fees implementation partner expensive"
21. "Snowflake Cortex maintenance overhead admin full-time required"

### ROI and Value Realization
22. "Snowflake Cortex time to value months delayed insights"
23. "Snowflake Cortex ROI negative failed to deliver business value"
24. "Snowflake Cortex opportunity cost manual reporting workarounds"

**Focus**: True costs beyond licenses, delayed value realization
