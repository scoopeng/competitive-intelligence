**From Testing**: Query attempted to run 3 separate analyses:
```sql
-- Query 1: Basic churn analysis
SELECT CHURN, COUNT(*) as customer_count...

-- Query 2: Tenure analysis
SELECT 'Tenure Analysis' as analysis_type...

-- Query 3: Contract analysis
SELECT 'Contract Analysis' as analysis_type...
```

2. **Time Intelligence**: Month-over-month calculations fail on SQL execution
3. **ML Analysis**: "Why are customers churning?" rejected by Snowflake (3-statement limit)
4. **Investigation Depth**: Cannot build multi-step analyses

## Bottom Line: What Snowflake CAN vs CANNOT Do

### What Cortex CAN Do
✅ Generate syntactically correct SQL
✅ Handle complex subqueries and CTEs
✅ Basic aggregations and statistical functions
✅ Integration with Slack/Teams (with development effort)
✅ Work within Snowflake's security boundary

### What Cortex CANNOT Do
❌ Answer WHY questions (multi-statement limitation)
❌ Preserve context between queries (stateless architecture)
❌ Provide complete business context (strips values from results)
❌ Handle temporal intelligence reliably (67% failure rate)
❌ Generate insights or recommendations
❌ Export to PowerPoint or Excel
❌ Self-service analytics (requires IT semantic modeling)
❌ Progressive investigation building

❌ 30-second setup for business users

### The Core Competitive Difference

**Cortex positioning**: "Generate SQL from natural language"
**Scoop positioning**: "Deliver business insights through intelligent reasoning"

Cortex solves a technical problem (SQL generation) while Scoop solves a business problem (insight generation). This fundamental difference in philosophy explains why Cortex achieves high SQL accuracy but low business utility.
