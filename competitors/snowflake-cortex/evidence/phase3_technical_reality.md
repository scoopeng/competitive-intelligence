## Performance Analysis (Searches 18-22)

### Search 18: Performance Benchmarks & Success Rates
**Query**: "Snowflake Cortex Analyst performance benchmarks query success rate limitations 2024 2025"

**Key Findings**:
- Snowflake claims **90%+ SQL accuracy** on real-world use cases
- Limited to well-organized, relational data with aggregates/filters
- Cannot handle JSON/VARIANT data directly
- Regional availability limited to select AWS and Azure regions
- Billing model: one message per request (successful calls only)

**Performance Gap Analysis**:
- **Marketing vs Reality**: 90% accuracy for SQL generation ≠ 90% business question success
- **Scope Limitation**: Only answers "SQL-based questions" vs full business analysis
- **Data Structure Dependency**: Requires structured columns, fails on semi-structured data

### Search 19: Query Limits & Timeout Performance
**Query**: "Snowflake Cortex Analyst query limits timeout performance issues"

**Technical Limitations Identified**:
- **1 MB semantic model file limit** (32K tokens after cleanup ≈ 128KB)
- **Conversation length constraints**: Long conversations become slower and more expensive
- **Query timeout parameters**: Configurable but performance degrades with complexity
- **Stateless processing overhead**: Full history reprocessed each query iteration

**Performance Issues**:
- Model loses track in very long conversations
- Context window limitations require conversation resets
- SQL-only capability - no insightful analysis beyond basic computations
- Balancing accuracy, latency, and costs remains "daunting task"

### Search 20: Stateless Architecture Limitations
**Query**: "Snowflake Cortex Analyst stateless architecture limitations context management"

**Architectural Constraints**:
- **No persistent memory**: LLMs process each multi-turn request from scratch
- **Cannot reference previous results**: If query 1 asks "What are my products?" and query 2 asks "What is revenue of the second product?", Cortex cannot connect them
- **Context handling**: Preceding questions must be included in request messages
- **Conversation drift**: Frequent intent shifts break interpretation capability
- **Size limitations**: 1MB semantic model limit for manageability

**Business Impact**:
- Applications must implement their own conversation history management
- No access to previous query results for follow-up analysis
- Each turn increases compute cost with full history reprocessing
- Complex investigations requiring multi-step reasoning are impossible

### Search 21: Semantic Model Performance Requirements
**Query**: "Snowflake Cortex Analyst semantic model performance requirements costs"

**Technical Requirements**:
- **File size limits**: 1MB total, 32K tokens after sample removal (≈128KB)
- **Model selection**: Meta Llama and Mistral models (Snowflake-hosted)
- **Warehouse sizing**: Maximum MEDIUM warehouse recommended
- **Cost structure**: Per-message billing (not token-based)

**Performance Factors**:
- 90%+ accuracy achieved through semantic model quality
- Larger warehouses don't improve performance but increase costs
- Long conversations exponentially increase costs
- On-demand accounts limited to 10 credits/day

### Search 22: SQL Generation Failures with Complex Queries
**Query**: "Snowflake Cortex Analyst SQL generation failures complex queries subqueries"

**Known SQL Generation Issues**:
- **Subquery limitations**: Cannot reference CTEs properly, requires base tables
- **Error correction system**: Multiple validation loops needed for syntax/semantic errors
- **Markdown backtick bug**: LLM adds formatting that breaks SQL execution
- **Hallucination prevention**: Core Snowflake services check for compilation errors

**Validation Against Existing Test Results**:
- Confirms **0% success on subquery patterns** (existing test result: 4/4 executed, 0/4 business expectation match)
- Validates **time intelligence failures** (existing test: 0% success on 15 queries)
- Supports **window function issues** documented in archive testing
