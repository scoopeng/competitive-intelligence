# Compact Summary: Ready for Fair Testing

## Situation
Testing Snowflake Cortex Analyst vs Scoop Analytics. Previous tests used wrong model (LLaMA instead of Claude-4-Sonnet), making comparison unfair.

## Key Discovery
Limited Claude-4-Sonnet testing shows BETTER performance than claimed:
- Time intelligence: 50% success (not 0%)
- Natural language: 100% success
- Investigation: 66% success

## Ready to Execute
```bash
python3 CLAUDE4_SONNET_TEST_FRAMEWORK.py
```

This will:
1. Test 90 queries (same as Scoop's suite)
2. Use Claude-4-Sonnet (fair comparison)
3. Test on TELCO_DATA and OPENOPPORTUNITIES
4. Generate comparison results

## Configuration
```python
account='rcdtonr-ji20455'
user='bradtest'
password='qMsGeKsE33NJeZp'
model='claude-4-sonnet'  # Critical!
```

## Files Status
- 133 changes (after cleanup)
- All evidence preserved in archive/
- Master findings in MASTER_CONSOLIDATED_FINDINGS.md
- Test framework ready

## After Testing
1. Analyze category performance
2. Document Query JSON Object advantages
3. Update reports with fair comparison
4. Commit verified results

## Critical Context
The architectural difference (Query JSON Object vs direct SQL) remains valid regardless of model. But we need fair model comparison for credibility.
