### Archive Research (49 MD files + 34 Python files)
**Key Historical Insights from Archive:**
- 88+ query comprehensive benchmark
- Azure connection testing (rcdtonr-ji20455 instance)
- Semantic model requirements discovery
- Time intelligence failure analysis (0% success rate)
- Statistical functions gap identification
- UI limitations documentation

## Critical Findings Already Captured

### 1. Comprehensive Benchmarking Results
**Test Scale**: 28 definitive queries across 10 capability categories
**Overall Success Rate**: ~35% for Cortex vs 100% implied for Scoop
**Critical Failure Categories**:
- Subqueries: 4/4 executed but 0/4 matched business expectations
- Window Functions: Failed on time intelligence
- Investigation Queries: Returns data, not insights
- Formula Filters: 3/3 executed but 0/3 matched expectations

### 2. Architectural Limitations Identified
**Fundamental Difference**:
- Cortex: Stateless LLM generating single SQL queries
- Scoop: Stateful reasoning engine with multi-stage investigation

**Key Technical Gaps**:
- Cannot maintain context between queries
- No multi-pass reasoning capability
- Limited to SQL generation, not business analysis
- Missing statistical functions (STDEV, CORR)

### 3. Business Impact Analysis
**Cost Evidence**: $50K-100K+ annual implementation costs
**Setup Requirements**: 4+ hours with 17 Python packages
**Trial Limitations**: Not available on trial accounts
**Workflow Gap**: Limited to Snowflake console, no integration

### 4. Test Infrastructure in Place
**Working Azure Connection**:
```python
account='rcdtonr-ji20455'  # Azure format
user='bradtest'
warehouse='COMPUTE_WH'
database='SCOOP_BENCHMARK'
```

**Semantic Model**: Complete YAML configuration for testing
**Test Suite**: 28 queries covering all business scenarios

### 5. Sales Positioning Materials
**Battle Card**: Complete with objection handlers and cost breakdowns
**Demo Scenarios**: Three killer queries identified:
1. "Show customers from top 5 regions" (subquery failure)
2. "Month-over-month growth" (window function failure)
3. "Why are customers churning?" (investigation failure)

## Key Evidence Already Documented

### 1. WHY vs WHAT Distinction
**Cortex Response to "Why are customers churning?"**:
- Returns aggregated data showing churn rates
- No causal analysis or ML insights
- Cannot provide actionable recommendations

**Scoop Capability**:
- Multi-step investigation with decision trees
- ML feature importance analysis
- Actionable recommendations with business impact

### 2. Technical Architecture Evidence
**Query JSON Validation**: Code analysis from AIQuery.java showing pre-execution validation
**Multi-Date Intelligence**: SCOOP_DKEY system for temporal analysis
**Change Tracking**: Native _CHG table integration
**Reasoning Engine**: 4-phase process (Plan → Execute → Interpret → Synthesize)

### 3. Business User Empowerment
**40+ Interactive Features**: Documented in SlackInteractionHandler.java
**PowerPoint Generation**: Automated deck creation
**Multi-Channel Integration**: Slack, email, Excel export
**Conversation State**: Preserved context vs Cortex's stateless approach
