# Master Consolidated Findings: Snowflake Cortex vs Scoop Analytics

## Current Situation (as of Sep 21, 2025)

### What We Know For Certain

#### 1. Test Evidence Summary
- **99 queries documented** across 11 categories (per MASTER-TESTING-SUMMARY.md)
- **Most tests used LLaMA 3.1-70b**, not Claude-4-Sonnet
- **Limited Claude-4-Sonnet testing**: Only 20-23 queries
- **Key finding**: Model comparison is unfair (Scoop uses Claude-4-Sonnet)

#### 2. Verified Technical Limitations (Model-Independent)

##### Proven Issues:
1. **Semantic Model Dependency**
   - 0% success without semantic context (proven with Claude-4-Sonnet)
   - 100% success with context on BASIC queries only

2. **Window Function Errors**
   - Markdown backticks break SQL: ```` causes syntax errors
   - Affects ALL time intelligence queries

3. **Missing Statistical Functions**
   - STDEV - "Unknown function STDEV"
   - CORR - Not available
   - PERCENTILE_CONT - Missing
   - VARIANCE - Not supported

4. **Architectural Limitation**
   - Direct SQL generation vs Query JSON Object
   - Cannot express multi-step logic
   - No subquery support for hierarchical filtering

#### 3. Claude-4-Sonnet Actual Results (Limited)
From 20 queries tested at 12:49am:
- Natural language: 3/3 passed (100%)
- Investigation: 2/3 passed (66%)
- Time intelligence: 2/4 passed (50%) - **NOT 0% as claimed!**
- Various failures on advanced features

**Critical insight**: Claude-4-Sonnet performs BETTER than documented

### Key Learnings from Overnight Testing

#### From archive/MASTER_FINDINGS.md:
1. **Query JSON Object is the key differentiator** - Enables capabilities impossible with direct SQL
2. **Subquery pattern** ("show X from top N Y") appears in countless business questions
3. **Time intelligence** requires window functions that Cortex breaks with markdown
4. **Investigation queries** return raw data, not insights

#### From archive/COMPREHENSIVE-CAPABILITY-ANALYSIS.md:
- Tested patterns beyond simple queries
- Confirmed multi-step analysis impossible
- Validated that even with perfect semantic model, architectural limits remain

#### From archive/CLAUDE4-SONNET-TEST-RESULTS.md:
- **100% success WITH semantic context** (8/8 queries)
- **0% success WITHOUT context** (0/15 queries)
- Proves absolute dependency on semantic model

### What Needs Fair Testing

#### Must Test with Claude-4-Sonnet:
1. All 90 queries from Scoop's test suite
2. Both datasets (TELCO_DATA, OPENOPPORTUNITIES)
3. Compare architectural advantages for each failure

#### Available Resources:
- **Test Framework Ready**: CLAUDE4_SONNET_TEST_FRAMEWORK.py
- **Datasets Verified**: Both exist in SCOOP_BENCHMARK.TEST_DATA
- **90 Test Queries**: Imported from Scoop's categories

### Documents to Keep (Core Evidence)

#### Primary:
1. **THIS FILE** - Master consolidated findings
2. **CLAUDE4_SONNET_TEST_FRAMEWORK.py** - Fair test framework
3. **archive/** - All historical evidence preserved

#### Analysis (Update After Testing):
1. **RESEARCH_REPORT_SCOOP_VS_CORTEX.md** - Needs model disclaimer
2. **GARTNER_STYLE_REPORT.md** - Needs fair comparison update

### Documents to Remove (Redundant)
- CONSOLIDATED_AUDIT_FINDINGS.md
- FINAL_AUDIT_SUMMARY.md  
- COMPLETE_FILE_ACCOUNTING.md
- READY_FOR_FAIR_TESTING.md
- SCOOP_VS_CORTEX_ULTIMATE_COMPARISON.md (unverified claims)

## For Compact Continuation

### Critical Context:
1. **Previous tests mostly used LLaMA**, not Claude-4-Sonnet (unfair)
2. **Claude-4-Sonnet shows 50% success on time intelligence** (not 0%)
3. **Architectural limitations remain valid** regardless of model
4. **Need to run CLAUDE4_SONNET_TEST_FRAMEWORK.py** for fair comparison

### Test Configuration:
```python
SNOWFLAKE_CONFIG = {
    'account': 'rcdtonr-ji20455',
    'user': 'bradtest',
    'password': 'qMsGeKsE33NJeZp',
    'warehouse': 'COMPUTE_WH',
    'database': 'SCOOP_BENCHMARK'
}

MODEL = 'claude-4-sonnet'  # MUST use this for fair comparison

DATASETS = {
    'TELCO_DATA': {'schema': 'TEST_DATA', 'table': 'TELCO_DATA'},
    'OPENOPPORTUNITIES': {'schema': 'TEST_DATA', 'table': 'OPENOPPORTUNITIES'}
}
```

### Next Actions After Compact:
1. Run `python3 CLAUDE4_SONNET_TEST_FRAMEWORK.py`
2. Analyze results by category
3. Document Query JSON Object advantages for failures
4. Update reports with fair comparison

### What We're Testing:
- 90 queries across 8 categories (matching Scoop's test suite)
- Both datasets for comprehensive coverage
- Fair model comparison (Claude-4-Sonnet vs Claude-4-Sonnet)

### Expected Outcomes Based on Limited Testing:
- Basic queries: High success (was 100%)
- Time intelligence: Mixed (was 50%, not 0%)
- Investigation: Partial (was 66%)
- Subqueries: Likely fail (architectural)
- Statistical: Likely fail (missing functions)

### Key Files Status:
- 138 total changes (all accounted for)
- 50 files archived (preserved)
- Core evidence intact
- Ready for fair testing

## Bottom Line

The overnight testing revealed important insights but used wrong model for comparison. We have:
1. Preserved all evidence in archive/
2. Created fair test framework
3. Ready to run proper Claude-4-Sonnet comparison

The architectural differences (Query JSON Object vs direct SQL) remain the key differentiator regardless of model performance.
