## Key Findings Summary

### What We Found:
1. **Legitimate Company**: Founded 2018 by UW-Madison professors, $25M Series A in 2021
2. **Enterprise Presence**: AWS Marketplace, Snowflake Native App, Gartner listing
3. **One Success Story**: Fortune 100 tech company analyzing $15B in contracts
4. **Platform Positioning**: No-code, generative AI analytics for business users
5. **Technical Reality**: Never sends data to LLMs, built-in security controls

### What We DIDN'T Find (Red Flags):
1. **Zero User Reviews**: No reviews on G2, Capterra, TrustRadius (unprecedented for 7-year-old product)
2. **No Community Presence**: Zero Reddit discussions, no user forums, no Stack Overflow
3. **No Implementation Issues**: Suspiciously no complaints, failures, or challenges documented
4. **No Industry Specialization**: No vertical-specific implementations or case studies
5. **No User Testimonials**: Only company-generated content, no third-party validation
6. **No Consultant Ecosystem**: No systems integrators or consultants discussing the platform

### Interpretation:
The complete absence of both positive AND negative user feedback after 7 years is highly unusual. This suggests either:
1. **Very Limited Adoption**: Few actual users despite enterprise positioning
2. **Private/Stealth Mode**: Focusing on large enterprise deals without public presence
3. **Recent Pivot**: May have recently pivoted to current offering
4. **Marketing vs Reality Gap**: Strong marketing presence but limited actual deployment

### Competitive Implications:
- Cannot validate claims through user experiences
- No evidence of business user empowerment in practice
- No proof of successful implementations beyond one story
- Complete lack of community suggests minimal adoption
- The "no reviews" fact is itself a powerful competitive point
