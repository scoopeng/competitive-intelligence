**Reasoning**: Complete IT dependency. Cannot setup without technical infrastructure. Zero self-service setup.

### Questions (2/6)
**Score**: 2/6
**Evidence**:
- Natural language capability via GEL (Guided English Language)
- Two-step process: NL → GEL → Execution (Phase 2/Phase 4)
- Business context dictionary required for domain terms (Phase 4)
- Works but adds complexity through intermediary layer
- Some NL capability exists
**Source**:
- Phase 2: "DataChat uses GEL (Guided English Language) as intermediary"
- Phase 4: "Two-step process adds complexity"
**Reasoning**: NL exists but through complex intermediary. Can ask questions but not as natural as direct processing. 2/6 for working but complex.

## Scoring Rationale: Why 11/50

**Extremely Low Score Because**:
- **ZERO Excel** - automatic 0/4 on Native Integration (complete workflow failure)
- **NO API** - automatic 0/3 on Portal Prison (confirmed multiple times)
- **Complex interface** - automatic 0/3 (GEL intermediary, no training, zero users)
- **No investigation** - automatic 0/4 (single query SQL translator)
- **Black box ML** - automatic 0/3 (no explainability)
- **No schema evolution** - automatic 0/4
- **No presentation automation** - automatic 0/3 on Speed, 0/4 on Brand
- **No speed data** - automatic 0/3 on Speed (Autonomy)

**Only Scores Points For**:
- GEL intermediary exists (2/3 questions - works but complex)
- GEL transparency (3/3 explanations)
- Basic visualization (1/3)
- Good connectivity (2/2)
- Data prep (2/2)
- Possible writeback (1/2)

**Total**: 2+0+3+1+5 = 11/50

**Why 1 Point Lower Than Old Framework (11/50 vs 12/50)**:
- New framework properly penalizes NO API (0/3 portal prison vs previous higher)
- Interface complexity better captured (0/3 vs previous 1/3)
- But GEL transparency recognized (3/3 on Explanation)
- Zero user validation properly impacts Autonomy (0/4 setup, 0/3 speed)

## Validation Notes

**Score is defensible because**:
- **ZERO Excel confirmed**: Phase 2 extensive search found nothing
- **NO API confirmed**: Multiple confirmations in Phase 2 & 4
- **ZERO reviews**: Documented across all platforms in Phase 1
- BUA measures business user independence - DataChat fails completely

**This is "Dashboard Tool"** not analytics platform:
- SQL translator with GEL intermediary
- Cannot investigate (single query only)
- Requires IT setup (GCP, databases)
- Zero workflow integration (no Excel/PowerPoint/Slack)
- Zero user validation (no reviews after 7 years)
- Market rejected it ($3.7M revenue proof)

**Why 11/50 Specifically (TIED FOR WORST)?**:
- Tied with Tableau Pulse (11/50): Both complete failures on flow and investigation
- Tied with Tellius (11/50): Both have zero flow, failed NL, no investigation
- Lower than DataGPT (12/50): Worse interface (0 vs 1), no API vs possible API
- Lower than Snowflake Cortex (13/50): Worse everything, zero users vs some
- Lower than Sisense (14/50): Worse interface, no API, zero users
- Lower than Power BI (14/50): Much worse, zero users, no API
- Much lower than any Category C tools (15-24)

**Why Category D (Dashboard Tool)?**:
- Requires IT for setup and maintenance
- SQL translation, not investigation
- Black box ML
- Portal prison with no API
- Zero validated users
- Tied for worst score with Tableau Pulse and Tellius
