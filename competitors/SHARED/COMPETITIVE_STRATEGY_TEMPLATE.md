- **Our Advantage**: [Specific Scoop capability that addresses this]
- **Emphasis Level**: [XX]% of web comparison

**#2: [Weakness Name]** (Severity: Critical | High | Medium)
- **Evidence**:
- **Why It Matters**:
- **Our Advantage**:
- **Emphasis Level**: [XX]%

**#3: [Weakness Name]** (Severity: Critical | High | Medium)
- **Evidence**:
- **Why It Matters**:
- **Our Advantage**:
- **Emphasis Level**: [XX]%

## 2. KEY SCENARIOS (Stories that expose weaknesses)

**Instructions**: Choose 2-4 real-world scenarios that make the competitor's weaknesses obvious. Good scenarios are specific, relatable, and measurable (time/cost differences).

**Scenario 1: [Scenario Name]**
- **When to Use**: [Which competitor weakness this exposes]
- **Story**: [1-2 sentence description of the scenario]
- **Expected Impact**: [Why this resonates with buyers]

**Scenario 2: [Scenario Name]**
- **When to Use**:
- **Story**:
- **Expected Impact**:

**Scenario 3: [Optional]**

## 3. TALKING POINTS (Emphasis hierarchy)

**Instructions**: Order these by importance. Top 3 should directly address primary weaknesses from Section 1.

**Lead With** (Most important - use these in first 1000 words):
1. [Point] - *Because [competitor weakness]*
2. [Point] - *Because [competitor weakness]*
3. [Point] - *Because [competitor weakness]*

**Always Mention** (Standard Scoop advantages):
4. [Point]
5. [Point]
6. [Point]

**De-Emphasize** (Don't lead with these, minor mentions only):
- [Point where gap is small or irrelevant]
- [Point where competitor is adequate]

---

## 4. CONTENT DISTRIBUTION (Word allocation for 7,500-word comparison)

**Instructions**: Allocate percentages based on competitor weaknesses. Default is balanced, adjust to emphasize areas where competitor is weakest.

**Recommended Mix**:
- **Section 1 (Executive Summary)**: [XX]% (~XXX words)
- **Section 2 (Capabilities)**: [XX]% (~XXX words)
  - UI/Workflow: [XX]%
  - Excel/Spreadsheet: [XX]%
  - ML/Investigation: [XX]%
  - Setup/Implementation: [XX]%
  - Schema Evolution: [XX]%
- **Section 3 (Cost/TCO)**: [XX]% (~XXX words)
- **Section 4 (Use Cases)**: [XX]% (~XXX words)
- **Section 5-7 (FAQ/Evidence/Next Steps)**: [XX]% (~XXX words)

**Rationale**:
[1-2 sentences explaining why this distribution makes sense for this competitor]

**Comparison to Default**:
- ⬆️ Increased: [Section name] (normally XX%, now XX%) - Because [reason]
- ⬇️ Decreased: [Section name] (normally XX%, now XX%) - Because [reason]

## 5. PROOF POINTS (Evidence to cite)

**Instructions**: Pull specific evidence that supports your positioning. Link to framework_scoring.md and research files.

**From Framework Scoring** (`evidence/framework_scoring.md`):
- **BUA Total**: [X/100] ([Category])
- **Lowest Dimension**: [Dimension Name] ([Score]/20)
- **Critical Sub-Scores**:
  - [Sub-component]: [Score]/[Max] (e.g., Native Integration: 0/8)
  - [Sub-component]: [Score]/[Max]

**From Research** (`evidence/research_library.md` or other sources):
- "[Specific quote or finding]" - [Source/URL]
- "[Customer pain point or limitation]" - [Source/URL]
- "[Performance data or benchmark]" - [Source/URL]

**From Public Documentation**:
- "[Vendor's own admission or limitation]" - [Official doc URL]
- "[Pricing or requirement]" - [Official doc URL]

## 6. WIN CONDITIONS (What makes us win)

**Instructions**: Be specific about when Scoop wins vs loses. Honesty here prevents wasted sales cycles.

**We Win When**:
1. [Condition] - *Because [competitor limitation]*
2. [Condition] - *Because [competitor limitation]*
3. [Condition] - *Because [competitor limitation]*
4. [Condition] - *Because [competitor limitation]*

**We Lose When** (Be honest):
- [Condition where competitor is actually better fit]
- [Scenario where competitor's approach makes sense]

**Neutral** (Could go either way):
- [Condition where both solutions work]

---

## 7. COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

**Instructions**: Craft the core positioning message. This should be memorable and accurate.

**One-Sentence Position**:
"[Competitor] is [what they really are], Scoop is [what we really are]"

**Elevator Pitch** (30 seconds, ~60 words):
[2-3 sentences capturing the core differentiation. Should mention their primary weakness and our primary strength.]

**Key Contrast**:
| Dimension | [Competitor] | Scoop |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Built For | [Their user] | Business users with Excel skills |
| Primary Interface | [Their interface] | Slack + Excel + PowerPoint |
| Deliverable | [What they give you] | Branded presentations with insights |
| Setup Time | [Their time] | 30 seconds |

## 8. AVOID OVER-CLAIMING (Credibility guardrails)

**Instructions**: List things we should NOT say because they're inaccurate or unprovable. Prevents credibility damage.

**Don't Say** (Risks credibility):
- "[Exaggeration]" - *Because [why this is inaccurate]*
- "[Over-claim]" - *Because [why we can't prove this]*
- "[Unfair characterization]" - *Because [why this is misleading]*

**Instead Say** (Evidence-based alternatives):
- "[Accurate statement]" - *Supported by [evidence]*
- "[Provable claim]" - *Supported by [evidence]*
- "[Fair characterization]" - *Supported by [evidence]*
