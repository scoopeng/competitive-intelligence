# Embeddable Analytics - Scoop's Platform Integration Revolution

## The Embeddable Advantage

While competitors force you to send users to their portals, Scoop can be embedded directly into YOUR application, keeping users in your product while providing world-class analytics.

### What This Means for SaaS Providers

**Your Product + Scoop = Complete Solution**

    ├── Statistical validation
    └── Your customers' data
```

### How It Works

1. Add Scoop chat widget to your application
2. Pass authentication context
