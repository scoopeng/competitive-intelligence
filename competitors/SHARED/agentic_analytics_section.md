### The Agentic Analytics Revolution

#### What is Agentic Analytics™?

While {COMPETITOR} processes single queries that return raw data, Scoop's patent-pending Agentic Analytics™ launches multiple specialized agents that investigate problems simultaneously, like having a team of expert analysts working in parallel.

**Traditional {COMPETITOR} Approach:**
```
User Question → Single Query → Database → Raw Data → End
(No investigation, no context, no root cause)
```

**Scoop's Multi-Agent Investigation:**
```
User Question: "Why did revenue drop?"
                    ↓
         ┌─────────────────────┐
         │ Agent Orchestrator   │
         │ Generates Hypotheses │
         └─────────┬───────────┘
                   ↓
    Launches 5-8 Specialist Agents in Parallel:
    
    ┌──────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┐
    │ Seasonality  │  Customer    │   Product    │
    │   Agent      │   Agent      │    Agent     │

                   ↓
         Each Agent Investigates:
         • Runs 2-3 queries
         • Tests hypotheses
         • Validates findings

    ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
    Mobile checkout failures increased 340%
    Impact: $430K monthly revenue loss
    Confidence: 94% (p < 0.001, n=12,432)
    Action: Fix payment gateway timeout
    Expected Recovery: Full by next week
```

#### How Multi-Agent Investigation Works

**Step 1: Hypothesis Generation**
When you ask "Why did revenue drop?", Scoop doesn't just query revenue. It generates multiple hypotheses:
- Could be seasonality (Seasonality Agent)
- Could be customer behavior (Customer Agent)
- Could be product issues (Product Agent)
- Could be competition (Competition Agent)
- Could be technical problems (Operations Agent)
- Could be market conditions (Market Agent)

**Step 2: Parallel Investigation**
Each agent investigates independently:
```python
# Seasonality Agent
- Compares to same period last year
- Checks for holiday impacts
- Analyzes day-of-week patterns

# Customer Agent  
- Segments customer analysis
- Checks for churn patterns
- Analyzes purchase frequency

# Product Agent
- Reviews product mix changes
- Checks inventory levels
- Analyzes pricing changes

# Operations Agent
- Scans for technical issues
- Checks system performance
- Reviews error logs

# Competition Agent
- Monitors competitor actions
- Checks market share changes
- Analyzes pricing pressure

# Market Agent
- Reviews economic indicators
- Checks industry trends
- Analyzes external factors
```

**Step 3: Statistical Validation**
Each finding is statistically validated:
- **Confidence Level**: How certain is this finding?
- **P-Value**: Is this statistically significant?
- **Sample Size**: How much data supports this?
- **Effect Size**: How big is the impact?

**Step 4: Synthesis & Recommendation**
The Synthesis Engine combines all findings:
```
INVESTIGATION COMPLETE (45 seconds, 23 queries executed)

PRIMARY FINDING:
Mobile checkout failures (73% of revenue drop)
- Started: July 15th after update
- Affected: Android users only
- Pattern: Timeout at payment step
- Evidence: 4,234 failed transactions

CONTRIBUTING FACTORS:
- Competitor promotion: 12% impact
- Seasonal decline: 8% impact  
- Inventory gaps: 7% impact

RECOMMENDATIONS (Prioritized):
1. Immediate: Rollback mobile update
2. Today: Contact affected customers
3. This Week: Implement fix properly
4. Strategic: Add checkout monitoring

CONFIDENCE: High (94%, p<0.001)
EXPECTED RECOVERY: $430K within 7 days
```

#### Why {COMPETITOR} Can't Do This

**{COMPETITOR}'s Limitations:**
- Single-threaded query execution
- No hypothesis generation
- No context between queries
- Can't investigate "why"
- No statistical validation
- No confidence scoring
- No automatic recommendations

**Scoop's Advantages:**
- Parallel multi-agent execution
- Automatic hypothesis testing
- Context maintained across investigation
- Finds root causes, not just symptoms
- Statistical rigor on every finding
- Confidence levels included
- Actionable recommendations

#### Progressive Analysis Modes

You control how deep Scoop investigates:

**Quick Analysis (30 seconds)**
- 3-5 queries
- High-level findings
- 80% confidence
- Good for routine questions

**Standard Analysis (60 seconds)**
- 5-8 queries
- Detailed investigation
- 90% confidence
- Default mode

**Deep Analysis (2-3 minutes)**
- 10-15 queries
- Exhaustive investigation
- 95%+ confidence
- For critical decisions

**Custom Analysis**
- You set parameters
- Control depth vs speed
- Specify confidence requirements
- Define hypothesis priorities

#### Real Customer Example

**Question**: "Why did customer satisfaction drop?"

**{COMPETITOR} Response**: 
"Customer satisfaction score: 72 (down from 85)"

**Scoop's Investigation**:
```
MULTI-AGENT INVESTIGATION (52 seconds)

Agents Deployed:
✓ Customer Agent: Analyzed feedback patterns
✓ Product Agent: Checked feature changes
✓ Operations Agent: Reviewed response times
✓ Support Agent: Analyzed ticket patterns
✓ Competition Agent: Monitored alternatives

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
Support response time increased 340% (4hr avg)
- Cause: 3 agents on vacation simultaneously
- Impact: 1,234 customers affected
- Correlation: Each hour delay = -2 NPS points

SECONDARY FACTORS:
- New feature confusion: -3 NPS points
- Competitor campaign: -2 NPS points

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Immediate: All-hands support coverage
2. Today: Auto-response with realistic timeline
3. This Week: Hire 2 additional agents
4. Strategic: Implement coverage policy

EXPECTED RECOVERY:
- NPS +8 points within 14 days
- Customer save: 234 at-risk accounts
- Revenue protection: $180K MRR
```

This is the difference between a query tool and an investigation engine.
