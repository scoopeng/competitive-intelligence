# Battle Card: Zenlytic

**BUPAF Score**: 18/50 (Category C - Enterprise Platform)
**Market Position**: AI chatbot with no depth, transparency, or customer validation
**Key Weakness**: ZERO Excel support + No multi-pass investigation + Ghost town reviews

---

## Quick Win Discovery Questions
1. "Can you show me any Zenlytic customer reviews on G2?"
2. "How does Zenlytic handle Excel formulas in your workflows?"
3. "What happens when you need to investigate WHY a metric changed?"

## Killer Facts
- **ZERO Excel formula support** - Can't process any of 150+ functions
- **ZERO customer reviews** - Ghost town on G2/Reddit despite $9M funding
- **NO multi-pass investigation** - Single query only vs Scoop's 3-10
- **NO automatic ML** - No J48, JRip, or clustering capabilities
- **NO mobile apps** - Web-only limits field teams
- **NO public documentation** - Hidden technical requirements

## Head-to-Head

| Factor | Zenlytic | Scoop | Your Win |
|--------|----------|-------|----------|
| Excel Support | ❌ ZERO formulas | ✅ 150+ functions | "Forces workflow abandonment" |
| Investigation Depth | ❌ Single query | ✅ Multi-pass (3-10) | "Can't find root causes" |
| ML Discovery | ❌ None | ✅ J48, JRip, EM | "No pattern detection" |
| Time to Value | Days with consultants | 30 seconds | "$300/hr vs instant" |
| Customer Proof | ❌ ZERO reviews | ✅ Proven ROI | "No validation despite $9M" |
| Mobile Access | ❌ Web only | ✅ Full mobile | "Can't support field teams" |

## Workflow Integration Gap

**Zenlytic Reality**: Conversational AI with critical gaps
- ZERO Excel formula support - breaks existing workflows
- No PowerPoint integration mentioned anywhere
- Slack available but can't do deep analysis

**Scoop Advantage**: Business tools for business users
- =SCOOP() formulas business users understand
- PowerPoint your executives expect
- Slack where teams collaborate

**Time Impact**: Weeks of YAML configuration before first insight

## Objection Handlers

**"Zenlytic has AI with Zoë"**
"AI that can't process Excel formulas or investigate 'why' questions isn't intelligent. It's a chatbot. Scoop has 150+ Excel functions AND automatic multi-pass investigation."

**"They claim 3-second responses"**
"Fast surface-level answers. When you ask WHY revenue dropped, Zenlytic gives one query. Scoop automatically runs 3-10 investigations to find root causes."

**"Zenlytic just raised $9M"**
"Yet ZERO customer reviews exist on G2 or Reddit. $9M in funding but not one customer testimonial? That's concerning."

## The Winning Pitch
"Zenlytic raised $9M but has ZERO customer reviews on G2 or Reddit - not one. They can't process a single Excel formula, offer no multi-pass investigation, and have no mobile apps. Their 'AI' is just single-query responses that can't dig into root causes. You need Analytics8 consultants at $300/hour just to implement it, and even then it takes days. Compare that to Scoop: 30-second setup, 150+ Excel functions, automatic 3-10 pass investigations, proven ML algorithms, and actual customer success stories. Why gamble on a ghost town when you can have proven business empowerment?"

## Proof Points
- Show their YAML documentation (intimidating)
- Ask who will maintain semantic models
- Calculate IT hours for YAML maintenance
- Demo business user independence

## Evidence-Based Reality

**Customer Validation**:
- Zenlytic: 0 reviews on G2
- Zenlytic: 0 posts on Reddit
- Zenlytic: No Gartner coverage
- Scoop: Proven customer ROI

**Actual Capabilities**:
- Excel formulas: ZERO vs 150+
- Investigation: Single vs Multi-pass
- ML algorithms: None vs J48/JRip/EM
- Implementation: Days vs 30 seconds

## Red Flags for Buyers
- **Zero market validation** - No reviews anywhere
- **No technical transparency** - No public docs, SLAs, or limits
- **Consultant dependency** - Analytics8 needed for setup
- **Single-query prison** - Can't investigate deeply
- **Excel workflow killer** - Forces tool abandonment
- **75-80% automated** - Means 20-25% still manual
