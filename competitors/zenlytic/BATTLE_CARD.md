# Battle Card: Zenlytic

**BUA Score**: 22/59 (37%, Category C)
**Market Position**: Chat interface for single-query Q&A
**Scoop Wins**: Excel engine + Multi-pass investigation + Automatic ML

---

## Quick Win Discovery Questions
1. "Can you upload an Excel file and have your formulas work on live data?"
2. "Who maintains your YAML configuration files when metrics change?"
3. "When Zoë answers a question, how many follow-up investigations does she run automatically?"

## Scoop's Core Advantages
- **Complete Excel Engine**: 150+ functions work on live data
- **Multi-Pass Investigation**: 3-10 automatic queries to find root causes
- **Automatic ML Discovery**: J48, JRip, EM clustering without user knowing

- **Visual Intelligence**: AI-generated presentations with your brand

## Zenlytic's Specific Pain Points
- **YAML configuration required**: Everything needs YAML files
- **GitHub dependency**: Version control for metrics required
- **Semantic layer complexity**: Must define all metrics upfront
- **Consultant dependency**: Analytics8 implementation often needed
- **20-25% manual setup**: Even with "75% automation"

## Objection Handlers

**"Zenlytic has AI"**
"AI that gives one answer. Scoop runs 3-10 investigations automatically with ML algorithms finding patterns you didn't ask about."

**"It's conversational"**
"Chat without depth. Ask 'why did sales drop?' - Zenlytic says '-15%'. Scoop finds the Western region product mix issue through multi-pass investigation."

**"They're easy to use"**
"Easy after days of YAML configuration. Every metric needs definition in code. Scoop works in 30 seconds with your existing Excel files."

**"Zenlytic has version control"**
"Great for developers, painful for business users. Your analysts become YAML maintainers instead of insight generators."

## The Winning Pitch
"Scoop is a complete Digital Data Analyst with an Excel brain, investigative instincts, and ML expertise. Upload any Excel file - your formulas work immediately on live data. Ask 'why did sales drop' and Scoop runs 3-10 investigations automatically, using J48 decision trees and EM clustering to find patterns you'd never discover. Zenlytic requires YAML configuration files, GitHub repositories, and semantic layer definitions before you can ask your first question. It gives one answer and stops - no investigation, no ML discovery, no Excel support. While they're writing YAML and waiting for consultants, your team is finding root causes in 30 seconds using the tools they already know."

## What Scoop Does That Zenlytic Can't

**The Excel Revolution**
- Upload Excel → Formulas work on live data
- =SCOOP() functions in any cell
- VLOOKUP, SUMIFS, pivot tables all work
- No migration, no retraining

**The Investigation Engine**
- User asks "why?" → 3-10 automatic queries
- Tests hypotheses like a human analyst
- Remembers context across investigations
- Finds root causes, not just symptoms

**The ML Discovery**
- Runs J48, JRip, EM automatically
- Finds patterns without being asked
- Delivers rules like "IF age>45 AND spend>$5K THEN loyal"
- No data scientist needed


## Quick Demo Script

**Excel Test**: "Upload this Excel file with formulas"
- Zenlytic: Can't process Excel
- Scoop: All formulas work instantly

**Configuration Test**: "Add a new metric"
- Zenlytic: Write YAML, commit to GitHub
