# Battle Card: Zenlytic

**BUPAF Score**: 18/50 (Category C - Analyst Workbench)
**Market Position**: YAML configuration platform disguised as AI
**Key Weakness**: ZERO Excel support + YAML engineering required

---

## Quick Win Discovery Questions
1. "Who maintains your Zenlytic YAML files?"
2. "How long to add a new metric or dimension?"
3. "What percentage of business users can write YAML?"

## Killer Facts
- **ZERO Excel support** - Not even export capability
- **YAML configuration hell** - Everything requires YAML files
- **GitHub required** - Version control for metrics
- **No ML models** - Only LLM for text-to-SQL (90% accuracy)
- **No independent reviews** - Zero presence on G2/Reddit
- **No multi-pass investigation** - Single query only

## Head-to-Head

| Factor | Zenlytic | Scoop | Your Win |
|--------|----------|-------|----------|
| Excel Support | ❌ ZERO | ✅ 150+ functions | "Can't even export to Excel" |
| ML Models | ❌ None | ✅ J48, JRip, EM | "No actual ML despite claims" |
| Investigation | ❌ Single query | ✅ Multi-pass (3-10) | "Can't find root causes" |
| Configuration | YAML + GitHub | 30 seconds | "Engineering project vs instant" |
| Market Validation | ❌ No reviews | ✅ Customer proven | "Ghost town on G2/Reddit" |
| Business Users | ❌ YAML required | ✅ Natural language | "IT bottleneck forever" |

## Workflow Integration Gap

**Zenlytic Reality**: Terminal and Git for analytics
- No Excel integration - not even exports
- No PowerPoint capability - not their focus
- No Slack integration - technical portal only

**Scoop Advantage**: Business tools for business users
- =SCOOP() formulas business users understand
- PowerPoint your executives expect
- Slack where teams collaborate

**Time Impact**: Weeks of YAML configuration before first insight

## Objection Handlers

**"Zenlytic has version control"**  
"Great for developers, terrible for business users. Your marketing manager isn't going to write YAML and submit pull requests for campaign analysis."

**"It's powerful once configured"**  
"After weeks of YAML writing. And every change needs more YAML. Scoop works in 30 seconds and adapts automatically."

**"We have technical users"**  
"Then they're doing configuration instead of analysis. Zenlytic turns analysts into YAML maintainers."

## The Winning Pitch
"Zenlytic has ZERO Excel support - not even export. Everything requires YAML configuration files in GitHub. Their own CEO admits 90% accuracy is 'absolutely terrible' for analytics. Despite $9M in funding, they have zero presence on G2 or Reddit - no independent reviews exist. You're looking at weeks of YAML engineering before getting single-query responses that can't investigate root causes. Scoop works in 30 seconds with 150+ Excel functions, automatic ML models, and multi-pass investigation - no YAML, no GitHub, actual business empowerment."

## Proof Points
- Show their YAML documentation (intimidating)
- Ask who will maintain semantic models
- Calculate IT hours for YAML maintenance
- Demo business user independence

## Technical Reality
```yaml
# Zenlytic metric definition example
- name: revenue
  type: measure
  sql: SUM(order_total)
  filters:
    - status != 'cancelled'
  description: "Total revenue from completed orders"
  format: currency
```
**vs Scoop**: "Show me revenue trends"

## Red Flags
- Documentation assumes technical expertise
- "Zoë" AI is just SQL generation
- No actual ML algorithms
- Requires data warehouse
- Business users need constant IT support
