## Objection Handlers

**"Zenlytic has AI"**
"AI that gives one answer. Scoop runs 3-10 investigations automatically with ML algorithms finding patterns you didn't ask about."

**"It's conversational"**
"Chat without depth. Ask 'why did sales drop?' - Zenlytic says '-15%'. Scoop finds the Western region product mix issue through multi-pass investigation."

**"They're easy to use"**
"Easy but shallow. No Excel support, no automatic discovery, no root cause analysis. Scoop works in your existing Excel files with formulas intact."

## The Winning Pitch
"Scoop is a complete Digital Data Analyst with an Excel brain, investigative instincts, and ML expertise. Upload any Excel file - your formulas work immediately on live data. Ask 'why did sales drop' and Scoop runs 3-10 investigations automatically, using J48 decision trees and EM clustering to find patterns you'd never discover. Zenlytic? It's chat that gives one answer and stops. No Excel support, no multi-pass investigation, no ML discovery. While they're typing questions one at a time, your team is getting root causes, discovering segments, and building presentations - all in 30 seconds in the tools they already use."
