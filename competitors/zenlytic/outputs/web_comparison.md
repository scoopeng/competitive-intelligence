## 3. INVESTIGATION DEPTH: MULTI-PASS REASONING VS SINGLE QUERIES

### The Investigation Intelligence Gap

#### Scoop's Multi-Pass Investigation Engine

**How Real Investigation Works**:
```
User asks: "Why did sales drop in Q4?"

Scoop automatically runs:
Query 1: "What changed between Q3 and Q4?"
Query 2: "Which regions drove the decline?"
Query 3: "What was different about those regions?"
Query 4: "When exactly did the change start?"
Query 5: "Which products were most affected?"
Query 6: "What customer segments changed behavior?"
Query 7: "What external factors correlate with timing?"

Result: "Western region's enterprise customers delayed purchases due to budget freeze starting October 15th, concentrated in software products over $50K"
```

**Investigation Architecture**:
- **3-10 SQL queries** per investigation
- **Context preservation** across queries
- **Hypothesis testing** with evidence building
- **Root cause discovery** through systematic analysis

#### Zenlytic's Single Query Limitation

**What Zenlytic Provides**:
```
User asks: "Why did sales drop in Q4?"
Zenlytic response: "Sales decreased 15% in Q4"
```

**No Follow-Up Investigation**:
- Single query response only
- No automatic hypothesis testing
- No context retention for deeper analysis
- User must ask follow-up questions manually
- Cannot build evidence across multiple queries

**The CEO's Own Admission**:
"No multi-pass investigation capability" documented in competitive research - Zenlytic answers one question and stops.
