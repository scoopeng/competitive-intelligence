# Tellius - Competitive Intelligence

## Quick Summary
**Category**: Marketing Mirage (BUPAF Score: 14/50)  
**Fatal Flaws**: 
- 90% employee turnover ("lightyears behind competitors")
- Zero Reddit/community presence (no user base)
- Natural language "has not been adopted" (own admission)
**Key Facts**: 
- $125,000+ Year 1 (25x advertised price)
- Customers calling it "a rip-off" and "false promises"
- NO Excel integration (wants to replace Excel entirely)
**Reality Check**: Failed platform with extreme risk, hidden costs, and no viable path forward  

## The Scoop Advantage
- **User requirement**: Business users vs data scientists
- **Setup**: 30 seconds vs 12+ weeks
- **Cost**: $3,588/year vs $100K+ plus implementation
- **ML explainability**: Transparent vs black box
- **Independence**: Self-service vs expert-dependent

## Key Differentiators

### 1. The Data Scientist Requirement (Fatal)
**Reality**: Business users can't use it
- Need Python/R knowledge
- Statistical expertise required
- Complex interface
- Not self-service
- **Defeats the purpose** of democratization

### 2. Implementation Complexity
| Phase | Time | Cost |
|-------|------|------|
| Setup | 12+ weeks | $50K+ services |
| Training | 2-4 weeks | Additional cost |
| Adoption | 3-6 months | Productivity loss |
| Total | 6+ months | $100K+ invested |

### 3. Black Box ML Problem
- Can predict but can't explain
- No root cause visibility
- Business users don't trust it
- "Magic number" syndrome
- No actionable insights

### 4. Enterprise Trap
**Built for data teams, not business users**:
- Complex UI requiring training
- Technical jargon throughout
- Assumes statistical knowledge
- Multi-step processes
- Not intuitive

## Discovery Questions
1. "How many data scientists do you have?"
2. "What's the technical skill level of your business users?"
3. "How long can you wait for implementation?"
4. "Do you need explanations or just predictions?"
5. "Can your team write Python or R?"

## Objection Handlers

**"Tellius has real AI/ML"**
→ "For data scientists. Can your sales team use it? Marketing? Finance? Real democratization means everyone can use it, not just PhDs."

**"It's recognized by Gartner"**
→ "In the augmented analytics space for data teams. After 12+ weeks and $100K+, you still need data scientists. That's not democratization."

**"We need advanced analytics"**
→ "Tellius provides advanced analytics for data scientists. Scoop provides powerful analytics for business users. Which drives more value?"

**"They have automated insights"**
→ "Black box insights that don't explain why. Knowing something will happen without knowing why doesn't help you prevent or accelerate it."

## The Skill Gap Reality
**What Tellius requires**:
- Understanding of statistical models
- Ability to interpret ML outputs
- Knowledge of data preparation
- Comfort with technical interfaces
- Patience for complex workflows

**What business users have**:
- Domain expertise
- Business context
- Excel knowledge
- Need for quick answers
- No time for training

## Competitive Landmines
- Don't deny their ML capabilities
- Focus on accessibility gap
- Emphasize data scientist requirement
- Show implementation timeline

## The Black Box Problem
**Tellius**: "Sales will drop 15% next quarter"
**Business**: "Why? What can we do?"
**Tellius**: "The model says so"
**Business**: "That doesn't help"

**vs**

**Scoop**: "Sales will drop because of these three factors..."
**Business**: "Now we can act"

## ROI Reality Check
| Investment | Tellius | Scoop |
|------------|---------|-------|
| Software | $100K+/year | $3,588/year |
| Implementation | $50K+ | $0 |
| Training | Weeks | None |
| Data scientists | Required | Not needed |
| Time to value | 6+ months | 30 seconds |
| **True cost** | **$150K+ year 1** | **$3,588** |

## The Enterprise Sales Reality
- Long sales cycles (3-6 months)
- Multiple stakeholders required
- POC process lengthy
- IT heavily involved
- Budget approval complex

## The Closing Line
"Tellius is powerful analytics for data scientists at $100K+ per year with 12-week implementations. Scoop is powerful analytics for business users at $3,588 per year with 30-second setup. Do you want to hire data scientists or empower the team you have?"
