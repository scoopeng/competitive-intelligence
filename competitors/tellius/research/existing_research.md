### Key Existing Knowledge

#### Positioning
- **BUPAF Score**: 20/50 (Category C - Analyst Workbench)
- **Fatal Flaw**: Requires data scientists to operate
- **Market Position**: Real ML but enterprise complexity

#### Economics
- **Pricing**: $100,000+/year typical enterprise cost
- **Implementation**: 12+ weeks at $50K+ services
- **Training**: 2-4 weeks additional cost
- **Total Investment**: $100K+ over 6+ months

#### Technical Reality
- Requires Python/R knowledge
- Statistical expertise required
- Complex interface
- Not self-service
- Black box ML - can predict but can't explain
- No Excel integration (dashboard only)
- No PowerPoint integration
- No Slack capability

#### Competitive Intelligence
- Genuine ML but poor accessibility
- "Genius" feature still requires expertise
- Heavy services component to revenue
- Limited customer base despite capabilities
- Struggles with business user adoption

### Sources Already Documented
The sources/ folder contains detailed analysis on:
1. AI capabilities and limitations
2. Business user barriers to adoption
3. Implementation complexity details
4. Pricing and ROI analysis
5. Competitive positioning

### Gaps to Fill in Research
- Customer implementation stories and failures
- Specific industry vertical limitations
- Community feedback (Reddit, forums)
- Performance metrics and scalability issues
- Direct competitive win/loss scenarios
- Recent updates or changes (2024-2025)
- Quantified technical limitations
- Integration failures and API issues
