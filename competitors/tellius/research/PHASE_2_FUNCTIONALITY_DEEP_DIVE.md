## Sales Battle Card: Tellius Functionality Gaps

### MAJOR GAPS WHERE SCOOP WINS:

1. **Excel Integration**
   - **Tellius:** Wants to replace Excel entirely
   - **Scoop:** Enhances Excel with =SCOOP() formulas
   - **Sales Message:** "Why abandon Excel when you can enhance it?"

2. **Implementation Speed**
   - **Tellius:** Days/weeks of enterprise setup
   - **Scoop:** 30 seconds in Excel/Slack/PowerPoint
   - **Sales Message:** "Analytics in 30 seconds vs 30 days"

3. **Visual Intelligence**
   - **Tellius:** Basic export to static files
   - **Scoop:** AI-powered PowerPoint with brand detection
   - **Sales Message:** "Automatic presentations vs manual exports"

4. **Collaboration Integration**
   - **Tellius:** No native Slack/Teams support
   - **Scoop:** Native Slack/Teams integration
   - **Sales Message:** "Work where your team works"

### COMPETITIVE AREAS:

1. **Root Cause Analysis:** Both platforms strong
2. **Embedded Analytics:** Tellius has good capabilities
3. **ML Algorithms:** Both support similar algorithms

### TELLIUS WEAKNESSES TO EXPLOIT:

1. **Natural language adoption failure** - "average analyst still relies on canned reports"
2. **Complex learning curve** for "citizen data scientists"
3. **Enterprise-only pricing** excludes smaller teams
4. **Mobile limitations** vs full web experience
5. **Integration complexity** requiring custom development

### EVIDENCE-BASED OBJECTION HANDLERS:

**"But Tellius is a Gartner Visionary"**
- "That's for enterprise complexity. Our customers want simplicity that actually gets adopted. Even Tellius admits 'Natural Language Search has not been adopted for analytics within most organizations.'"

**"Tellius has more advanced ML"**
- "Advanced doesn't mean better. They acknowledge problems with 'ambiguous language, mismatched definitions, and unreliable multi-step logic.' Scoop's proven algorithms work invisibly."

**"Tellius handles bigger data"**
- "Most business decisions don't need 50M rows. They need fast answers. Scoop delivers insights in Excel where decisions happen, not in another platform to learn."
