# Tellius Customer Stories & Implementation Experiences

## Implementation Horror Stories

### 1. 90% Employee Turnover Crisis
**Source**: Glassdoor Employee Review
**Impact**: Operational instability
**Details**: "Turnover rate for employees is in the 90% range. Most people last less than a year"
- Product described as "lightyears behind other competitors"
- Biggest YoY drop in Gartner Magic Quadrant (both Ability to Execute and Vision)
- Management accused of "lies, deceit, and favoritism"

### 2. 6-Week to 6-Month Implementation Reality
**Source**: Tellius Blog (own admission)
**Timeline**:
- Weeks 1-2: Initial setup
- Weeks 2-4: Data engineering
- Weeks 4-6: Agent deployment  
- Months 3-6: Broader scaling with cross-functional teams
**Pain Points**: 
- "Practical challenges ('battle scars') from demo to production"
- "Without semantic definitions, AI outputs risk being inconsistent or incorrect"
- Requires "five essential frameworks for strong governance"

### 3. Performance & Reliability Issues
**Source**: G2 Reviews
**Customer Quote**: "The tool hangs sometimes, which might be because of less compute power or plan"
**Impact**: 
- Workflow disruptions
- "Sometimes the trends do not give valuable insights"
- Performance tail-latency acknowledged by Tellius

### 4. Cost Barriers for Smaller Companies
**Source**: G2 Reviews
**Quote**: "The cost is the deciding factor, and it might be expensive for smaller companies"
**Reality**: Hidden costs not disclosed upfront

### 5. Natural Language Adoption Failure
**Source**: Tellius Documentation (own admission)
**Critical Admission**: "Natural Language Search has not been adopted for analytics within most organizations"
**Reasons**:
- "ambiguous language, mismatched definitions"
- "performance tail-latency, lack of observability"
- "unreliable multi-step logic"
- "the average analyst still relies on canned reports or dashboards"

## Customer Complaints & Frustrations

### Data Privacy Concerns
**Source**: Five.Reviews
**Customer**: Anonymous
**Quote**: "They use your data for their own gain"
**Complaint**: "The user experience has been negative at best and the service lies to you in order to be marketable"

### False Promises
**Source**: Five.Reviews
**Quote**: "They promise to provide you with AI-driven decision intelligence but in reality they are just providing you with false promises"
**Label**: "a rip-off"
**Recommendation**: "looking for a different provider"

### Learning Curve Reality
**Source**: G2 Reviews
**Quotes**:
- "Some users may find Tellius a bit complex, especially if they are new to advanced analytics"
- "The platform's extensive capabilities may require a learning curve"
- Despite claims of natural language ease

### Mobile Limitations
**Source**: Multiple Reviews
**Issue**: "The mobile app may not offer as comprehensive functionality as the web version"
**Impact**: Limited on-the-go access for field teams

## Industry-Specific Limitations

### Manufacturing
**Finding**: Cannot directly integrate with plant floor systems
**Impact**: Requires separate middleware/integration tools
**Quote**: "not designed as a plant floor integration tool"

### Retail
**Performance Issue**: "performance tail-latency" at scale
**Claim vs Reality**: "What once took 20+ hours is now done in under 30 minutes" BUT with latency issues

### General Enterprise
**Integration Reality**: Requires separate middleware for most industry-specific integrations
**Hidden Complexity**: Not the plug-and-play solution marketed

## Market Position Red Flags

### Gartner Magic Quadrant Decline
- Biggest YoY drop in BOTH Ability to Execute AND Completeness of Vision
- Employee confirmed: "Tellius had the biggest drop in both quadrants"

### No Community Presence
- ZERO reviews on Capterra ("Be the first to review!")
- NO Reddit discussions in r/BusinessIntelligence or r/analytics
- Limited LinkedIn professional engagement beyond company page
- 31 total customers globally (very small footprint)

### Internal Culture Issues
**Employee Testimonial**: "Worst company I have ever worked for"
**Specific Issues**:
- "Toxic work culture specially backend department"
- Young inexperienced VPs who "hoard information"
- CEO "easily manipulated"
- Forced positive reviews from certain offices

## Competitive Switching Patterns

### No Public Migration Stories
**Finding**: ZERO documented cases of companies switching FROM Tellius
**Interpretation**: 
- May indicate small market footprint
- Customers may be locked in
- Failures may not be catastrophic enough for public disclosure

### Alternatives Being Evaluated (G2)
Companies evaluating alternatives to Tellius:
1. Domo
2. Oracle Analytics Cloud  
3. QlikView
4. Oracle Essbase
5. WebFOCUS
6. BOARD International

## Bottom Line for Sales

**Fatal Flaws to Highlight**:
1. 90% employee turnover = unstable product/support
2. 6-week minimum implementation = not the quick solution promised
3. Natural language "has not been adopted" = their core promise failed
4. No community/Reddit presence = no grassroots adoption
5. "Tool hangs sometimes" = unreliable for business-critical decisions

**Positioning**: "Would you trust your business intelligence to a company with 90% turnover, where their own employees say the product is 'lightyears behind competitors'?"
