# Tellius Performance Analysis

## Performance Claims vs Reality

### Marketing Claims
- "Elastic, on-demand scaling with zero maintenance"
- "Queries of complex data returned instantly"
- "Powered by Apache Spark for high performance"
- "Scales up to big data use cases"
- "Billions of rows of data" capability

### User-Reported Reality

#### Performance Issues (G2 Reviews)
**Direct Quote**: "The tool hangs sometimes, which might be because of less compute power or plan"
- **Impact**: Unpredictable performance
- **Cause**: Tied to pricing tier
- **Frequency**: Regular enough to be mentioned in reviews

#### Insight Quality Issues
**Quote**: "Sometimes the trends do not give valuable insights"
- **Problem**: Performance not just speed, but accuracy
- **Impact**: Wasted compute cycles on poor results

### Technical Architecture

#### What's Documented
- Apache Spark backend
- In-memory compute
- Distributed architecture
- Microservices-based
- Auto-scaling capability

#### What's Missing
- No public benchmarks
- No performance SLAs
- No sizing guidelines
- No optimization guides
- No troubleshooting docs

## Scalability Analysis

### Concurrent Usage
**Standard Tier**: 5 concurrent jobs
**Enterprise Tier**: "Unlimited" concurrent jobs
**Reality Check**: No actual concurrency numbers provided

### Data Volume Capabilities
**Claim**: "Billions of rows"
**Evidence**: No customer testimonials with specific volumes
**Concern**: Performance "hangs" suggest limits hit quickly

### User Scalability
**Premium**: Capped at 5 users ($495/month)
**Enterprise**: "Unlimited" (custom pricing)
**Hidden Factor**: Performance degrades with user growth

## Performance Comparison

### vs ThoughtSpot
- ThoughtSpot: Documented 2-3 second response times
- Tellius: No published response times
- ThoughtSpot: Proven at scale (2,108% more revenue)
- Tellius: 31 customers total

### vs Tableau
- Tableau: Requires .hyper extracts for performance
- Tellius: Claims live query superiority
- Reality: Both struggle with large datasets

### vs Scoop
- Scoop: 30-second setup, immediate results
- Tellius: 6-week implementation before first query
- Scoop: Works with existing infrastructure
- Tellius: Requires Spark cluster setup

## Infrastructure Requirements

### Published Requirements
- None found publicly

### Implied Requirements (from architecture)
- Apache Spark cluster
- Significant memory for in-memory compute
- Distributed file system support
- Elastic compute capability
- Professional services for setup

## Performance Red Flags

### 1. No Public Benchmarks
**Industry Standard**: Vendors publish TPC benchmarks
**Tellius**: Zero performance benchmarks available
**Implication**: Performance claims unverifiable

### 2. Plan-Based Performance
**Finding**: Performance tied to pricing tier
**Problem**: Pay more for acceptable performance
**Impact**: Hidden cost escalation

### 3. Compute Power Complaints
**User Feedback**: Blaming "less compute power"
**Reality**: Underprovisioned by default
**Cost Impact**: Need enterprise tier for basic performance

### 4. No Optimization Guides
**Search Result**: No performance tuning documentation
**Impact**: Customers can't improve performance
**Dependency**: Requires professional services

## Response Time Analysis

### What We Know
- "Instantly" claimed for complex queries
- Reality: "Tool hangs sometimes"
- No specific response time commitments
- No timeout configurations documented

### Industry Standards
- Sub-second: Expected for simple queries
- 2-5 seconds: Acceptable for complex
- 10+ seconds: User abandonment
- Tellius: No commitments

## Database Performance

### Integration Performance
**Finding**: No database timeout documentation
**Impact**: Integration issues undocumented
**Reality**: Each connector performs differently
**Support**: No public troubleshooting

### Query Optimization
- No query optimization guides found
- No indexing recommendations
- No partitioning strategies
- No caching documentation beyond basic

## Bottleneck Indicators

### Memory Constraints
- In-memory compute = memory bottleneck
- No memory sizing guides
- "Hangs" suggest memory pressure
- Scaling requires more RAM ($$)

### Compute Limitations
- Spark overhead not discussed
- Distributed overhead ignored
- Network latency impact unknown
- Cold start times undocumented

## Customer Impact

### Productivity Loss
- Hanging tools = waiting users
- Unreliable insights = rework
- No optimization path = frustration
- Professional services dependency = delays

### Hidden Costs
- Upgrade to enterprise for performance
- Additional compute resources
- Professional services for tuning
- Potential platform replacement

## Performance Testing Gaps

### What's Missing
1. Load testing results
2. Stress testing documentation  
3. Benchmark comparisons
4. Sizing calculators
5. Performance monitoring guides
6. Optimization playbooks
7. Troubleshooting guides

## The Reality

**Bottom Line**: Tellius markets "instant" and "elastic" but delivers "hangs sometimes" with no public performance documentation. The complete absence of benchmarks, optimization guides, or troubleshooting documentation means customers are flying blind on performance.

**For Sales**: "Ask Tellius for specific performance benchmarks with your data volume. If they claim 'instant' results, why do users report the tool 'hangs sometimes'? Where are the performance SLAs?"
