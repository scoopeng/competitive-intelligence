## Sales Battle Cards Against Tellius

### If They Lead With "Visionary"
"Visionary with 'product gaps' and 'infant developer communities' according to Gartner. Plus their own employees report the 'biggest drop' in the quadrant."

### If They Lead With "Natural Language"
"Their own documentation admits 'Natural Language Search has not been adopted.' Why bet on a failed approach?"

### If They Lead With "Elastic Scaling"
"Users report 'tool hangs sometimes.' How elastic is it really? Ask for benchmarks."

### If They Lead With "AI-Driven"
"AI that requires 6-week implementation and professional services. Our AI works in 30 seconds."

## The Bottom Line

**Market Reality**: Tellius is a small player in a consolidating market, stuck between enterprise giants and agile disruptors, with no clear differentiation beyond marketing claims.

**Competitive Position**: Weak and getting weaker. The 90% employee turnover, zero community presence, and "biggest drop" in Gartner positioning suggest a company in crisis, not growth.

**For Sales**: "Tellius has 31 customers globally after years in market. Their top competitor has 2,108% more revenue. Do you want to bet on the struggler or the leader?"
