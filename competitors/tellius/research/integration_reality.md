## The Professional Services Dependency

### Why Services Are Mandatory
1. No documentation = can't DIY
2. No examples = trial and error
3. No community = no peer help
4. No patterns = reinventing wheel
5. No tools = manual everything

### Typical Services Engagement
**Discovery**: $10k to understand needs
**Design**: $15k to architect solution
**Implementation**: $25k+ to build
**Testing**: $10k to validate
**Training**: $10k to transfer knowledge
**Total**: $70k+ per major integration

## Integration TCO Impact

### Hidden Costs Per Integration
| Integration Type | Service Cost | Time | Maintenance |
|-----------------|--------------|------|-------------|
| Database | $15-25k | 2-4 weeks | $5k/year |
| ERP | $30-50k | 4-8 weeks | $10k/year |
| Cloud Platform | $20-30k | 3-5 weeks | $7k/year |
| Custom API | $25-40k | 4-6 weeks | $8k/year |

### 5-Year Integration TCO
**Initial Setup**: $100k+ (4-5 integrations)
**Annual Maintenance**: $30k+
**Upgrades**: $20k/year
**Changes**: $15k/year
**5-Year Total**: $325k+

## Competitive Integration Comparison

### vs ThoughtSpot

- **Winner**: Power BI

### vs Scoop
- Excel native (=SCOOP())
- Slack commands work instantly
- No integration needed
- **Winner**: Scoop

## Red Flags Summary

### Critical Integration Failures
1. **No API documentation** = vendor lock-in
2. **No Excel integration** = workflow disruption
3. **No Slack/Teams** = collaboration gap
4. **No troubleshooting** = support dependency
5. **No community** = no shared knowledge

### What This Means for Customers
- Can't integrate independently
- Every connection costs money
- No upgrade path
- Vendor lock-in extreme
- Hidden costs massive

## The Integration Verdict

**Bottom Line**: Tellius is an integration nightmare. Zero public documentation, no developer resources, no community support, and mandatory professional services for every connection makes it one of the least integration-friendly platforms in the market.

**For Sales**: "Ask Tellius for their public API documentation. When they can't provide it, ask how you'll integrate without it. The answer is $70k+ in professional services per integration."
