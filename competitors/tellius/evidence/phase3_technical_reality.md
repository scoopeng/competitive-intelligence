## Competitive Win/Loss Analysis

### Why Tellius Loses Deals

#### To ThoughtSpot
- Market leadership (2,108% more revenue)
- Better community support
- Proven scale
- Clearer positioning

#### To Tableau
- Despite Tableau's complexity, it has:
  - Massive user base
  - Extensive training resources

### Why Tellius Wins (Occasionally)

#### Specific Use Cases
- Companies wanting to leave Tableau's complexity
- Need for "Visionary" vendor (Gartner)
- Specific elastic scaling requirements
- Consumption-based pricing preference

## Technical Debt Indicators

### Red Flags Found
1. **No Public Documentation**: Technical guides missing
2. **No Community**: Can't troubleshoot independently
3. **No Benchmarks**: Performance claims unverified
4. **No Error Guides**: Integration issues undocumented
5. **Employee Turnover**: 90% leaving = knowledge loss

### What This Means
- Heavy reliance on professional services
- Knowledge trapped with consultants
- Each implementation is custom
- Limited institutional knowledge
- High risk of project failure

## Sales Intelligence Summary

### Discovery Questions
1. "Can you share Tellius's performance benchmarks for your data volume?"
2. "What's included in professional services, and is it mandatory?"
3. "Why did Tellius drop in the Gartner quadrant according to employees?"
4. "How do you handle the 90% employee turnover impact on support?"
5. "Where's the public documentation for troubleshooting?"

### Competitive Positioning
**Against Tellius's "Elastic Scaling"**:
"They claim elastic scaling, but users report 'tool hangs sometimes.' Have you tested with your actual data volume?"

**Against "Visionary" Status**:
"Gartner calls them Visionary, but with 'product gaps' and 'infant developer communities.' Plus employees report the 'biggest drop' in the quadrant."

**Against Pricing Claims**:
"$495/month sounds good until you add implementation, customization, training, and ongoing support. Industry average puts that at $125,000+ year one."

### Fatal Technical Gaps
1. No performance SLAs or benchmarks
2. No public error documentation
3. No community for troubleshooting
4. No training program visible
5. No clear time-to-value metrics

## Bottom Line

**Technical Reality**: Tellius has interesting architecture (Spark, elastic scaling) but no evidence it delivers in production. The complete absence of public technical documentation, combined with 90% employee turnover, suggests significant technical debt and reliability issues.

**Economic Reality**: True cost is likely 10-25x the advertised price when including all hidden costs. With no public ROI cases or time-to-value metrics, buyers are taking a expensive leap of faith.

**Competitive Reality**: Stuck between giants (Tableau, ThoughtSpot) and nimble innovators (Scoop), Tellius lacks the market presence to compete with established players or the agility to match new entrants. The "Visionary" label can't hide the execution gaps.

## Extended Research: September 26, 2025

### Additional Technical Architecture Findings

#### Apache Spark Foundation Issues (2024-2025)
**New Evidence on Spark Performance Problems:**
- "Spark is notoriously difficult to tune and maintain" - requires expert management
- Common 2024 issues: GC overhead kills executors, memory crashes, slow task stragglers  
- "Jobs can crash due to lack of sufficient available memory" - only disk traces survive
- Spark performance requires "expertly managed" clusters or faces "heap of frustration and high costs"

**Tellius-Specific Impact:**
- Uses Apache Spark as core engine (confirmed)
- "Tool hangs sometimes" directly correlates with Spark memory issues
- No public Spark tuning guides for Tellius (customers on their own)
- Performance tail-latency acknowledged in Tellius documentation

### Updated Competitive Analysis (2024-2025)

#### Tellius vs Scoop Analytics - Direct Comparison
**Excel Integration - FATAL GAP:**
- **Tellius:** NO Excel formula engine - forces complete platform migration
- **Scoop:** Complete Excel engine with 150+ functions, =SCOOP() formulas work IN Excel
- **Tellius:** Export only to static files (CSV)
- **Scoop:** Live Excel connection, formulas run on real-time data

**Business User Focus:**
- **Tellius:** Requires "citizen data scientists" with analytics knowledge
- **Scoop:** "No SQL. No formulas. No training. Just type what you want"
- **Tellius:** Natural language "has not been adopted" (their admission)
- **Scoop:** Proven Excel approach with immediate adoption

#### Tellius vs ThoughtSpot - Updated Reality
**2024 Competitive Data:**
- Tellius claims 90%+ win rate in technical evaluations
- BUT ThoughtSpot generates 2,108% more revenue (massive size difference)

- Reality: Still requires technical expertise
- Same Spark issues persist

**Power BI Copilot:**
- 4.4 stars with 3,167 reviews (50x more than Tellius)
- Assists with DAX queries and NLP
- Limited to "summarizing/visualizing" not true analysis
- Microsoft ecosystem advantage

**Domo AI:**
- 1,000+ connectors vs Tellius's limited integrations
- AI Agents that auto-forecast and power chatbots
- Cloud-native architecture advantage
- Better suited for extensive connectivity needs

### Security & Compliance Update (2024)

#### What Tellius Has:
- SOC 2 Type II certification (achieved August 2023)
- No reported breaches or vulnerabilities to date
- Basic security controls in place

#### What's Missing:
- No GDPR compliance explicitly stated
- No HIPAA certification mentioned  
- No FedRAMP for government
- No industry-specific compliance
- No public SLAs or uptime guarantees

### Customer Success ROI - Complete Picture

#### Published Success Stories:
1. **PepsiCo:** 180 hours/year saved, reports from weeks to hours
2. **Financial Services:** $700,000/month credit loss reduction  
3. **eBay:** Tracked $163M donations, forex forecasting
4. **Pharmacyclics:** 4-6 weeks to minutes for dashboards
5. **Seneca College:** Days to minutes for insights

#### Critical Missing Context:
- NO implementation costs disclosed
- NO professional services fees mentioned
- NO training time/costs included  
- NO failed implementations documented
- NO customer churn data available
- Only 31 companies globally (tiny footprint)

### Market Reality Check (2025)

- **Employees:** 104 people  
- **Valuation:** $41.7M - $67.2M (very small for enterprise vendor)
- **Customers:** 31 globally (15 NA, 9 EMEA, 4 APAC, 3 LATAM)
- **Employee Turnover:** 90% (massive red flag)

#### Gartner Position Update:
- 2025: Named Visionary 4th year
- BUT: "Biggest drop in both Ability to Execute and Vision" (employee quote)
- Concerns: "product gaps," "infant developer communities"
- Behind leaders in execution and innovation

### Updated TCO Analysis (2025 Pricing)

#### Visible Pricing:
- **Premium:** $495/month for 5 users
- **Enterprise:** Custom quote only
- 14-day free trial available

#### Real TCO Components:
Based on industry analysis and Tellius specifics:
- **Implementation:** 6 weeks minimum (often 6 months)
- **Customization:** $5,000 - $500,000 depending on needs
- **Professional Services:** Required (no DIY path)
- **Training:** "Citizen data scientist" education needed
- **Apache Spark Management:** Ongoing expertise required
- **Support:** Unknown SLAs and response times

#### Estimated Year 1 TCO:
- Software: $15,000+ (Enterprise)
- Implementation: $50,000+ (6 weeks professional services)
- Customization: $25,000+
- Training: $10,000+
- Spark expertise: $20,000+
- **Total Year 1:** $120,000+ minimum

### Sales Intelligence: Updated Battle Points

#### Discovery Questions for 2025:
1. "How will you handle Apache Spark tuning and GC issues?"
2. "Can you afford 6 weeks before seeing any value?"
3. "With 90% employee turnover, who will support you long-term?"
4. "Why force Excel users to abandon their workflow?"
5. "How do you justify $120,000+ when Scoop works in 30 seconds?"

#### Objection Handlers - Evidence-Based:

**"Tellius has agentic AI"**
→ "Built on unstable Apache Spark that crashes from memory issues. Their 'agentic AI' still requires citizen data scientists."

**"They're a 4x Gartner Visionary"**
→ "With the biggest YoY drop in the quadrant and only 31 customers globally. Employees say it's 'lightyears behind competitors.'"

**"The price seems reasonable"**
→ "$495/month is just software. Add $50,000+ implementation, training, and Spark management. Real cost is $120,000+ year one."

**"They beat ThoughtSpot 90% of the time"**
→ "In technical demos maybe, but ThoughtSpot has 21x their revenue and 5x the reviews. Market has spoken."

### Final Technical Assessment

**Architecture:** Fundamentally flawed with Apache Spark dependency causing crashes and hangs

**Scalability:** Claims elastic scaling but users experience performance degradation

**Integration:** Forces Excel abandonment instead of enhancement - fatal flaw

**Support:** 90% turnover means no institutional knowledge

**Future:** "Agentic AI" marketing can't fix core platform issues

**Bottom Line:** Tellius is a small, struggling vendor with fundamental technical issues, minimal market presence, and a collapsing team trying to compete against giants with marketing buzzwords instead of stable technology.
