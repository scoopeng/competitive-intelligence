## Phase 1 Summary of Key Findings

### Customer Stories & Implementation Failures
1. **90% employee turnover** - "Most people last less than a year"
2. **Product behind competitors** - "lightyears behind other competitors"
3. **6-week to 6-month implementations** - Not the "quick setup" promised
4. **Performance issues** - Tool hangs, slow response times, "performance tail-latency"
5. **Zero presence on Reddit** - No community discussions or user groups found

### Industry Vertical Limitations

### Community Feedback

3. **TrustRadius**: Has listing but reviews not accessible

5. **LinkedIn**: Limited professional presence beyond company page

### Red Flags Discovered
