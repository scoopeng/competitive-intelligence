# Battle Card: Tellius

**BUA Score**: 30/100 (30%, Category C - Weak) ⬇️ DOWNGRADED  
**Market Position**: Failed platform with 90% employee turnover  
**Fatal Flaw**: Apache Spark crashes + NO Excel support + NL failed

---

## 🔥 Killer Discovery Questions
1. "How will you handle Apache Spark memory crashes and GC overhead?"
2. "Can you show me Tellius =TELLIUS() Excel formulas?" (doesn't exist)
3. "What's the TOTAL cost including Spark expertise?" ($120k+ Year 1)
4. "With only 31 customers globally, what's your bankruptcy plan?"
5. "Why does Tellius force complete Excel abandonment?"

## 💣 Devastating Facts
- **Apache Spark crashes** - Memory issues, GC overhead, "notoriously difficult"
- **31 customers globally** - After 8 years, smaller than most POCs
- **$120,000+ Year 1** - Includes $20k+ Spark expertise requirement
- **Zero Excel engine** - Forces complete Excel abandonment vs enhancement
- **90% employee turnover** - "Lightyears behind competitors"
- **$22.8M revenue** - ThoughtSpot has 21x more (~$500M)
- **"Natural language has not been adopted"** - Failed technology admission
- **"Tool hangs sometimes"** - Spark foundation causes crashes

## Head-to-Head Destruction

| Factor | Tellius | Scoop | Your Win |
|--------|---------|-------|----------|
| Architecture | ❌ Apache Spark crashes | ✅ Stable platform | "Memory crashes vs reliability" |

| Excel Support | ❌ ZERO - abandons it | ✅ 150+ functions | "Destroys vs enhances workflow" |
| Market Size | 31 customers | Growing fast | "Bankruptcy risk vs growth" |
| Setup Time | 6 weeks minimum | 30 seconds | "1000x slower" |
| Natural Language | ❌ "Not adopted" | ✅ Excel formulas | "Failed experiment" |

| Company Health | ❌ 90% turnover | ✅ Stable team | "Everyone quits" |

## Customer Horror Quotes

### From Employees
> "The product is lightyears behind other competitors"

> "Turnover rate is in the 90% range. Most people last less than a year"

> "Tellius had the biggest drop in both Gartner quadrants YoY"

### From Customers
> "They promise AI-driven intelligence but provide false promises"

> "A rip-off"

> "The tool hangs sometimes"

### From Tellius Itself
> "Natural Language Search has not been adopted for analytics"

> "ambiguous language, mismatched definitions, unreliable multi-step logic"

## The $120,000 Reality Check

### What They Hide
**Advertised**: $495/month (Premium)
**Reality**: $120,000+ Year 1
- Software: $15,000+
- Implementation: $50,000+ (6 weeks minimum)
- Customization: $25,000+
- Training: $10,000+ (citizen data scientists)
- Apache Spark Expertise: $20,000+ (ongoing requirement)

### 3-Year Disaster
- **Tellius**: $176,000 total
- **Scoop**: $10,764 total
- **Savings**: $165,236 (94% less)

## Objection Demolition

**"They have agentic AI analytics"**  
→ "Built on Apache Spark that crashes from memory problems. 'Notoriously difficult to tune' with 'heap of frustration.' That's not AI, it's instability."

**"They're 4x Gartner Visionary"**  
→ "With the biggest YoY drop in the quadrant. Only 31 customers after 8 years. That's not vision, it's failure."

**"They beat ThoughtSpot 90% of the time"**  
→ "In demos only. ThoughtSpot has 21x their revenue. Markets don't lie - customers choose ThoughtSpot."

**"The architecture scales"**  
→ "Apache Spark requires expert management or crashes. Users report 'tool hangs sometimes.' Budget $20k+/year for Spark expertise."

**"The price seems reasonable"**  
→ "$495/month is bait. Real cost: $120,000+ Year 1 with Spark expertise. That's 33x more than Scoop."

## The Winning Script

### Opening Salvo
"Before we discuss Tellius, you should know they have 90% employee turnover with staff saying it's 'lightyears behind competitors.' Still interested?"

### The Cost Trap
"Tellius advertises $495/month but customers pay $125,000+ in Year 1. That's false advertising. Want to see the breakdown?"

### The Adoption Failure
"Tellius's own documentation admits their natural language 'has not been adopted.' You're buying yesterday's failed experiment."

### The Support Nightmare
"With 90% turnover, your Tellius consultant will quit within a year. Then you start over at full cost. That's not a vendor, it's a liability."

### The Closing Kill
"Zero Reddit discussions. Zero Capterra reviews. 31 customers globally. 90% employee turnover. 'Tool hangs sometimes.' Natural language 'not adopted.' $125,000 for failure. Still considering them?"

## Competitive Intelligence

### What We Know
- Tiny customer base (31 companies)
- Massive employee turnover (90%)
- Product failing ("lightyears behind")
- Natural language abandoned
- Professional services dependent
- No community or ecosystem

### What This Means
- Company in crisis mode
- Product quality declining
- Support will deteriorate
- Acquisition or shutdown likely
- Customer risk extreme

### Sales Strategy
1. **Lead with turnover** - Instant credibility destroyer
2. **Expose true cost** - 25x price shock
3. **Quote employees** - "Lightyears behind"
4. **Show zero community** - No users = no value
5. **Close on risk** - "Can you afford failure?"

## Proof Points to Demand

### Ask Them For:
1. Public API documentation (doesn't exist)
2. Performance benchmarks (none available)
3. Customer community links (zero found)
4. Reddit discussions (absolutely none)
5. True Year 1 cost with services (they'll dodge)
6. Employee retention stats (90% quit)
7. Natural language adoption rates (failed)

### When They Can't Provide:
"If you can't show basic documentation or community, how can we trust implementation? This looks like vaporware with a $125,000 price tag."
