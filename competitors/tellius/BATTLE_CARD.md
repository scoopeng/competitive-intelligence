## The $125,000 Reality Check

### What They Hide
**Advertised**: $495/month (Premium)
**Reality**: $125,000+ Year 1
- Software: $15,000+
- Implementation: $50,000+
- Customization: $25,000+
- Training: $20,000+
- Each Integration: $70,000+

### 3-Year Disaster
- **Tellius**: $181,000 total
- **Scoop**: $10,764 total
- **Savings**: $170,236 (94% less)

## Objection Demolition

**"They're a Gartner Visionary"**  
→ "With 'product gaps' and 'infant developer communities.' Their own employees report the 'biggest drop' in both quadrants."

**"They have elastic scaling"**  
→ "That 'hangs sometimes' according to users. Where are the performance benchmarks? They don't exist."

**"They have natural language"**  
→ "Which they admit 'has not been adopted.' Their own documentation says it failed. Why bet on failure?"

**"They have AI/ML"**  
→ "Requiring 'citizen data scientists' and 6-week implementation. Plus it's 'lightyears behind competitors' per employees."

**"The price seems reasonable"**  
→ "$495/month is the trap. Real cost is $125,000+ Year 1. Check the professional services requirements."

## The Winning Script

### Opening Salvo
"Before we discuss Tellius, you should know they have 90% employee turnover with staff saying it's 'lightyears behind competitors.' Still interested?"

### The Cost Trap
"Tellius advertises $495/month but customers pay $125,000+ in Year 1. That's false advertising. Want to see the breakdown?"

### The Adoption Failure
"Tellius's own documentation admits their natural language 'has not been adopted.' You're buying yesterday's failed experiment."

### The Support Nightmare
"With 90% turnover, your Tellius consultant will quit within a year. Then you start over at full cost. That's not a vendor, it's a liability."

### The Closing Kill
"Zero Reddit discussions. Zero Capterra reviews. 31 customers globally. 90% employee turnover. 'Tool hangs sometimes.' Natural language 'not adopted.' $125,000 for failure. Still considering them?"

## Competitive Intelligence

### What We Know
- Tiny customer base (31 companies)
- Massive employee turnover (90%)
- Product failing ("lightyears behind")
- Natural language abandoned
- Professional services dependent
- No community or ecosystem

### What This Means
- Company in crisis mode
- Product quality declining
- Support will deteriorate
- Acquisition or shutdown likely
- Customer risk extreme

### Sales Strategy
1. **Lead with turnover** - Instant credibility destroyer
2. **Expose true cost** - 25x price shock
3. **Quote employees** - "Lightyears behind"
4. **Show zero community** - No users = no value
5. **Close on risk** - "Can you afford failure?"

## Proof Points to Demand

### Ask Them For:
1. Public API documentation (doesn't exist)
2. Performance benchmarks (none available)
3. Customer community links (zero found)
4. Reddit discussions (absolutely none)
5. True Year 1 cost with services (they'll dodge)
6. Employee retention stats (90% quit)
7. Natural language adoption rates (failed)

### When They Can't Provide:
"If you can't show basic documentation or community, how can we trust implementation? This looks like vaporware with a $125,000 price tag."
