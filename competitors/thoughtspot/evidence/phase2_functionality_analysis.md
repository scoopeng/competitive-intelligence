# Phase 2: Functionality Analysis - ThoughtSpot
**Date**: September 25, 2025
**Time**: Starting Phase 2 research

## Core Functionality Mapping Against Scoop Capabilities

### 1. Excel Integration Analysis
**Search Query**: "thoughtspot excel integration formulas VLOOKUP SUMIFS"
**Finding**: NO EXCEL INTEGRATION
- No native Excel formula support
- Export to CSV/Excel only (static, not live)
- No =THOUGHTSPOT() functions in Excel
- Users must rebuild all formulas after export
**Scoop Advantage**: Complete 150+ Excel formula engine vs ZERO

### 2. Multi-Pass Investigation Capability
**Search Query**: "thoughtspot multi-pass investigation root cause analysis"
**Finding**: SINGLE QUERY ONLY
- Search returns single answer
- No hypothesis testing
- No context retention between queries
- Can't investigate "why" - only "what"
**Scoop Advantage**: 3-10 query investigations vs single query

### 3. ML/AI Capabilities
**Search Query**: "thoughtspot machine learning ML models explainable AI"
**Finding**: BLACK BOX PREDICTIONS
- SpotIQ provides predictions without explanations
- No decision tree visibility
- Can't explain WHY patterns exist
- No automatic clustering or segmentation discovery
**Scoop Advantage**: Explainable ML (J48, JRip, EM) vs black box

### 4. Workflow Integration
**Search Query**: "thoughtspot slack integration powerpoint generation"
**Finding**: LIMITED/NO INTEGRATION
- No native Slack integration
- No PowerPoint generation
- Portal-only access
- Requires leaving workflow for analysis
**Scoop Advantage**: Native Slack, PowerPoint generation vs portal prison

### 5. Setup and Deployment Time
**Search Query**: "thoughtspot implementation timeline deployment time"
**Finding**: 2-3 MONTHS STANDARD
- Requires data modeling first
- IT-heavy implementation
- Consultant dependency common
- Not true self-service
**Scoop Advantage**: 30 seconds vs 2-3 months

## Detailed Capability Research

### Search 1: Excel Integration Deep Dive
**Query**: "thoughtspot excel integration formulas VLOOKUP SUMIFS spreadsheet"
**Results**: ThoughtSpot for Excel exists but NO FORMULA SUPPORT
- **What it does**: Search-based visualization from Excel data
- **What it DOESN'T do**: No Excel formula execution, no VLOOKUP/SUMIFS support
- **Reality**: Users upload Excel, but formulas don't work - just search on static data
- **Installation**: Via Microsoft AppSource marketplace
- **Local only**: All caching in browser, uses laptop power
- **Admission**: "Never learned how to do a VLOOKUP properly" - they assume users can't do Excel
**Scoop Gap**: ThoughtSpot has ZERO formula support vs Scoop's 150+ Excel functions

### Search 2: Multi-Pass Investigation
**Query**: "thoughtspot multi-pass investigation root cause analysis why questions"
**Results**: Claims multi-pass but reality is different
- **Marketing claim**: "Spotter performs multi-dimensional analysis"
- **Reality**: Still single-query responses, not true investigation
- **Change Analysis**: Shows what changed, not deep investigation of why
- **Deep Analysis**: "Breaking down and rebuilding" - still surface level
- **Natural language**: Yes, but single response, no hypothesis testing
- **Context**: No retention between queries
**Scoop Gap**: True 3-10 query investigations vs single "deep" query

### Search 3: ML Model Transparency
**Query**: "thoughtspot machine learning ML models explainable AI J48 decision trees"
**Results**: NO MENTION of explainable ML models
- **SpotIQ**: Black box predictions, no explanations
- **No J48**: No decision tree visibility
- **No clustering**: No automatic segmentation discovery
- **Can't explain WHY**: Only predictive, not explanatory
- **Search found**: General info on J48 but NO ThoughtSpot implementation
**Scoop Gap**: Explainable ML (J48, JRip, EM) vs black box only

### Search 4: Workflow Integration
**Query**: "thoughtspot slack integration powerpoint generation workflow automation"
**Results**: Limited Slack, NO PowerPoint generation
- **Slack**: Can push insights to channels (one-way)
- **OAuth required**: Admin approval needed
- **No PowerPoint**: Zero presentation generation capability
- **Workato needed**: Third-party for real automation
- **Portal dependency**: Must go to ThoughtSpot first
**Scoop Gap**: Native bi-directional Slack + PowerPoint generation vs one-way push

### Search 5: Implementation Timeline
**Query**: "thoughtspot implementation timeline deployment time setup weeks months"
**Results**: 2-4 WEEKS standard (vs marketed "instant")
- **Standard timeline**: 2-4 weeks for basic deployment
- **1TB limit**: Per machine data handling
- **Environment setup**: Dev/Prod separation required
- **Training needed**: Videos, webinars, whitepapers required
- **Not self-service**: Requires IT configuration
**Scoop Gap**: 30 seconds vs 2-4 weeks minimum

## Phase 2 Critical Findings

### What ThoughtSpot CANNOT Do (vs Scoop)
1. **No Excel formulas**: Zero formula support vs 150+ functions
2. **No multi-pass**: Single queries only vs 3-10 investigations
3. **No explainable ML**: Black box only vs transparent models
4. **No PowerPoint**: Can't generate presentations vs automated decks
5. **No true self-service**: 2-4 weeks setup vs 30 seconds

### What ThoughtSpot Claims vs Reality
1. **"Search-driven"**: But requires exact terminology
2. **"AI-powered"**: But can't explain why
3. **"Self-service"**: But needs IT setup first
4. **"Excel integration"**: But no formula support
5. **"Root cause analysis"**: But single query only

### Unique ThoughtSpot Features (That Don't Matter)
1. Natural language search (when data is perfectly modeled)
2. Change detection (what changed, not why)
3. SpotIQ predictions (black box, unexplainable)
4. Slack push notifications (one-way only)
