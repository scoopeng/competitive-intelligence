**Core Question**: Can business users investigate "why" questions or just search for "what" happened?

#### Search vs Investigation Architecture

| Aspect | ThoughtSpot | Scoop |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Query Approach | Single search queries | Multi-pass investigation |
| Questions Per Analysis | 1 (search paradigm) | 3-10 automated queries |
| Hypothesis Testing | Manual follow-up searches | Automatic (5-10 hypotheses) |
| Context Retention | No (each search independent) | Full conversation context |
| Root Cause Analysis | Limited to "what changed" | Built-in with confidence scoring |

#### Side-by-Side Example: "Why did customer churn increase?"

**ThoughtSpot Response:**
```
Search Results: Customer Churn Analysis
Churn Rate: 23% increase in Q3 2024
Total Churned Customers: 342
Top Factors: (Shows correlations in visualizations)
- Support tickets correlated with churn
- Usage patterns show variance
- Geographic differences visible
```

**Analysis**: ThoughtSpot shows what happened and displays correlations in dashboards, but requires manual follow-up searches to investigate deeper. Business users must construct their own investigation path.

**Scoop Response:**
```
Investigation completed (7 hypotheses tested, 8 queries executed):

PRIMARY CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Support ticket volume correlation
- Churned customers: Average 4.2 tickets in final 90 days
- Retained customers: Average 0.8 tickets in final 90 days
- Pattern: >3 tickets in 90 days = 87% churn probability
- ML Model Confidence: 94%

SECONDARY FACTOR: Feature adoption depth
- Churned: Used 2.1 features on average (shallow adoption)
- Retained: Used 5.7 features on average (deep integration)
- Pattern: <3 features used = 73% churn risk
- ML Model Confidence: 81%

TERTIARY FACTOR: Usage consistency patterns
- Churned: 12 days average between logins (sporadic)
- Retained: 2.3 days average between logins (habitual)
- Pattern: >7 days between logins = 68% churn risk
- ML Model Confidence: 76%

RECOMMENDATION: Monitor accounts with >3 tickets + <3 features + >7 day gaps
High-Risk Accounts Identified: 47 accounts matching all 3 criteria
Projected Churn Prevention: $920K ARR if immediate intervention

CONFIDENCE: 94% (based on 18 months historical data, n=12,432 customers)
```

## 3. USE CASES & SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: Healthcare Analytics (ThoughtSpot Cannot Compete)

**Use Case**: Hospital network with 12 facilities needs to analyze patient outcomes, treatment costs, and operational efficiency across locations.

**ThoughtSpot Fundamental Limitation**: Legal documentation explicitly states "shall not upload PHI" (Protected Health Information). This legal restriction makes ThoughtSpot unusable for:
- Patient outcome analysis
- Treatment effectiveness studies
- Cost per procedure calculations
- Readmission rate investigations
- Clinical pathway optimization
- Population health management

**Real-World Impact**: A major health system cannot analyze:
```
"Why do cardiac surgery outcomes vary between hospitals?"
"Which treatment protocols are most cost-effective?"
"What factors predict patient readmissions?"
```

**Scoop Healthcare Solution**: Full HIPAA compliance enables:

**Patient Outcome Investigation**:
```
Query: "Why do surgical infection rates vary by hospital?"

Scoop Investigation Results:
- Primary factor: Pre-op antibiotic timing (within 1 hour = 2.1% infection, >1 hour = 7.8%)
- Secondary factor: Surgeon experience level (>100 procedures = 1.9% infection)
- Tertiary factor: OR turnaround time (>45 minutes = 4.2% infection rate)

Recommendation: Standardize pre-op protocols, schedule experienced surgeons for complex cases
Potential impact: 65% infection reduction, $2.3M annual savings
```

**Treatment Cost Analysis**:
```
ML_CLUSTER discovers patient segments:
"Complex Comorbidity" patients (12% of volume, 34% of costs)
"Standard Care" patients (67% of volume, 45% of costs)
"Outpatient Candidates" (21% of volume, 21% of costs - opportunity for cost reduction)

Actionable insight: 15% of "Standard Care" patients could be outpatients
Cost savings: $4.2M annually
```

**Business Impact**: Healthcare organizations get full analytics capabilities that ThoughtSpot legally cannot provide, representing 20% of the enterprise market.

### Scenario 2: Financial Services Risk Management

**Challenge**: Investment bank needs to investigate portfolio risk drivers and optimize trading strategies across multiple asset classes.

#### Current State Analysis

**ThoughtSpot Approach**:
1. Risk manager searches "portfolio risk by asset class"
2. Views static dashboard showing risk metrics
3. Manually drills down into fixed income performance
4. Screenshots results for compliance report
5. Separately searches for trader performance data
6. Manually correlates market conditions with performance
7. Creates PowerPoint presentation from multiple screenshots
8. **Total time**: 4-6 hours per analysis
9. **Limitation**: Cannot investigate multi-factor interactions

**Scoop Investigation Approach**:
```
Query: "Why did fixed income trading performance decline in Q3?"

Automatic Investigation (8 queries executed):

PRIMARY CAUSE: Duration risk in rising rate environment
- 7-10 year bonds: -12.3% performance vs benchmark

One customer reported "$500k/yr for 20 people." Scoop provides comparable enterprise functionality at transparent pricing with zero infrastructure overhead and no implementation costs.

### Q: Can ThoughtSpot users work in Excel?

A: No. ThoughtSpot has zero Excel formula support and markets this as a feature ("Never learned how to do a VLOOKUP properly"). All analysis must happen in the ThoughtSpot portal. Users can export CSV files but cannot execute Excel formulas or maintain live connections. Scoop provides 150+ native Excel functions for data preparation and runtime calculations.

### Q: How accurate is ThoughtSpot vs Scoop?

A: ThoughtSpot shows 33.3% accuracy in Stanford HAI benchmarks (2 out of 3 queries fail), with black box predictions that cannot explain why patterns exist. Scoop provides deterministic results with confidence scoring and explainable ML models that show exactly why patterns occur. For business decisions requiring reliability, Scoop's transparency and accuracy provide higher confidence.

### Q: What about ThoughtSpot's SpotIQ AI capabilities?

A: SpotIQ is genuine ML (rare among competitors) but provides black box predictions without explanations. It can identify correlations but cannot explain why patterns exist or provide business rules. Scoop's AI Data Scientist Engine provides explainable ML (J48 decision trees, JRip rules, EM clustering) with business language explanations and confidence scores. Both have real ML, but Scoop explains the "why" behind patterns.

### Q: Can ThoughtSpot handle healthcare data?

A: No. ThoughtSpot's legal documentation explicitly states "shall not upload PHI" (Protected Health Information), excluding healthcare organizations from using it for patient data analytics. This represents a major limitation for the healthcare vertical. Scoop provides full HIPAA compliance for healthcare analytics without restrictions.

### Q: How does setup complexity compare between platforms?

A: ThoughtSpot requires 2-4 weeks minimum for data modeling, TML worksheet creation, search content preparation, and user training. IT must model all data relationships before business users can search effectively. Scoop takes 30 seconds with no data modeling requiredâ€”business users connect directly to data sources and begin investigation immediately.

### Q: What about total cost of ownership beyond licensing?

A: ThoughtSpot requires significant infrastructure (96 CPUs/600GB RAM for 2-3TB data), implementation consulting ($40K-$80K), ongoing maintenance ($20K-$40K annually), and potential professional services. One customer reported "$500k/yr for 20 people." Scoop includes all capabilities in transparent pricing with zero infrastructure overhead, no implementation costs, and automatic maintenance.

### Q: Can business users create their own analysis without IT help?

A: In ThoughtSpot, business users can search within pre-built data models and worksheets created by IT. They cannot model new data relationships, create complex calculations, or adapt when data structures change. Scoop enables complete business user autonomyâ€”they can connect new data sources, create sophisticated analysis with Excel formulas, and adapt automatically to schema changes.

### Q: How do the platforms handle data integration differently?

A: ThoughtSpot requires pre-modeling all data relationships into searchable worksheets. When data sources change or new connections are needed, IT must update models. Scoop connects directly to data sources without pre-modeling, automatically adapts to schema changes, and allows business users to combine data sources using familiar Excel formulas.

### Q: What happens when data structures change in source systems?

A: ThoughtSpot search models break when column names or data types change, requiring IT to rebuild worksheets and retrain users on new search terms. This is scored 0/4 on schema evolution in our framework. Scoop automatically adapts to schema changes without breaking existing analysis, maintaining continuity for business users.

### Q: Which platform is better for regulated industries?

A: For healthcare: Scoop only (ThoughtSpot legally cannot handle PHI). For financial services: Both can work, but Scoop's explainable ML meets regulatory requirements for model transparency. For manufacturing: Both suitable, but Scoop's Excel integration works better with existing quality control workflows. For government: Scoop available, ThoughtSpot banned from some government use.
