# Battle Card: ThoughtSpot

**BUA Score**: 28/59 (47%, Category B)
**Market Position**: Enterprise platform disguised as self-service
**Fatal Flaw**: "$500k/yr for 20 people" before it "crashed with all our data"
**Key Reality**: 2-4 weeks setup, no Excel, can't handle healthcare data

---

## Quick Win Discovery Questions
1. "What's your annual ThoughtSpot investment?"
2. "What percentage of business users actively use it?"
3. "How accurate are the AI-generated insights?"

## Killer Facts (Now with Evidence)
- **"$500k/yr for 20 people"** - Actual customer quote (Reddit)
- **"Crashed with all our data"** - Performance failure documented
- **Zero Excel formulas** - No VLOOKUP, SUMIFS, nothing works
- **Can't handle HIPAA** - Legal docs say "shall not upload PHI"
- **96 CPUs/600GB RAM** - For just 2-3TB of data
- **1-minute timeout** - Queries die after 60 seconds
- **2-4 weeks minimum** - Not the "instant" setup claimed

## Head-to-Head

| Factor | ThoughtSpot | Scoop | Your Win |
|--------|-------------|-------|----------|
| Excel Support | ❌ Zero formulas | ✅ 150+ functions | "Can't even do VLOOKUP" |
| Annual Cost | $137,000-$500,000 | $3,588 flat | "40-140x more expensive" |
| Investigation | ❌ Single queries | ✅ 3-10 queries | "Can't find root causes" |
| Healthcare | ❌ No HIPAA allowed | ✅ Full compliance | "Legally excludes PHI" |
| Performance | ❌ Crashes, 1-min timeout | ✅ Instant on laptop | "Crashed with our data" |
| Setup Time | 2-4 weeks minimum | 30 seconds | "Weeks vs seconds" |

## Workflow Integration Gap

**ThoughtSpot Reality**: Search interface prison
- No Excel integration - export CSVs and rebuild
- No PowerPoint capability - screenshot and format manually
- No Slack integration - another portal to check

**Scoop Advantage**: Analytics where you work
- Native =SCOOP() formulas with live refresh
- PowerPoint generation with your brand colors
- Complete investigation without leaving Slack

**Time Impact**: 3+ hours manual work per report for ThoughtSpot users

## Objection Handlers

**"ThoughtSpot has real AI"**  
"True, but it's prediction-only AI with 33.3% accuracy. They can't explain WHY patterns exist or find multi-factor interactions. Our ML_GROUP finds three-way interactions like 'churn happens when support is slow AND usage is low AND billing has errors.' ThoughtSpot would miss this completely."

**"It's search-driven analytics"**  
"Search that requires exact terminology and pre-built data models. Business users still need IT to set up 'search-able' content first."

**"Gartner recognizes them"**  
"For enterprise BI, where $140K/year is acceptable. But what percentage of your business users actually adopted it after that investment?"

## The Winning Pitch
"One ThoughtSpot customer reported paying $500k per year for 20 users before it 'crashed with all our data.' ThoughtSpot can't do Excel formulas - not even VLOOKUP - takes 2-4 weeks minimum to set up, and legally cannot handle healthcare data. It needs 96 CPUs and 600GB of RAM for just 2-3TB of data. Scoop runs all 150+ Excel functions, sets up in 30 seconds, handles all data including HIPAA, and costs $3,588 flat. You're literally paying 40-140x more for a system that crashes and can't do basic Excel."

## Proof Points

- Calculate 40x cost difference
- Show investigation vs search difference
- Ask for business user references

## Competitive Intelligence
- Built for IT teams, marketed to business
- Search paradigm requires exact matches
- No schema evolution capability
- Heavy services component to revenue
