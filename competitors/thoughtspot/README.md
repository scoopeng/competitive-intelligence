# ThoughtSpot - Competitive Intelligence

## Quick Summary
**Category**: IT Platform (BUA Score: 20/50)  
**Fatal Flaw**: 33.3% accuracy - 2 out of 3 answers wrong  
**Key Fact**: $140,000/year average cost (40x more than Scoop)  
**Reality Check**: Search-driven BI that still needs IT setup  

## The Scoop Advantage
- **Accuracy**: 95%+ vs their 33.3% benchmark
- **Investigation**: Multi-hypothesis reasoning vs single queries
- **Cost**: $3,588/year vs $140,000/year (40x difference)
- **Independence**: True self-service vs IT-dependent "search"

### Evidence & Proof Points
| Claim | Source | Impact |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 33.3% accuracy | Stanford HAI benchmark | 2 out of 3 wrong |
| $140K/year average | Enterprise pricing | 40x Scoop cost |
| 2-3 month setup | Customer reports | Quarter vs instant |
| IT dependency | Need data models first | Not self-service |

## Key Differentiators

### 1. The Accuracy Problem (Fatal Flaw)
**Benchmark Reality**: 33.3% accuracy vs 95.2% for leaders
- Ask 3 questions → 2 wrong answers
- Would you make decisions on 33% accuracy?
- **Use this stat** - it's devastating

### 2. Search vs Investigation
- **ThoughtSpot**: "Show me sales by region" (single query)
- **Scoop**: "Why did Northeast sales drop?" (investigates root cause)
- They answer WHAT, we discover WHY

### 3. The Hidden IT Dependency
Despite "search-driven" marketing:
- IT must build data models first
- Business users need exact terminology
- "Searchable" content requires setup
- Not true self-service

### 4. Black Box ML Problem
- Can predict trends but can't explain them
- No root cause analysis
- No multi-factor discovery
- Missing the "why" behind patterns

## Discovery Questions
1. "What's your accuracy rate with ThoughtSpot queries?"
2. "Can business users create their own data models?"
3. "How long was your implementation?"
4. "Can it explain WHY metrics change, not just predict?"

## Objection Handlers

**"ThoughtSpot has AI"**
→ "With 33.3% accuracy. That means 2 out of 3 insights are wrong. Would you make decisions on a coin flip?"

**"It's search-driven analytics"**
→ "Search that requires IT to set up data models first. Business users can only search what IT has pre-built. That's not self-service."

**"Gartner recognizes them"**
→ "Gartner also shows their average deal is $140K/year. For 40x our cost, you get 33% accuracy. Is that a good investment?"

**"We need predictive analytics"**
→ "ThoughtSpot can predict but can't explain. Knowing sales will drop is useless without knowing why. Scoop finds the root cause."

## The ML Comparison
| Capability | ThoughtSpot | Scoop |
|------------|------------|-------|
| Prediction | ✅ Black box | ✅ With explanation |
| Root cause | ❌ | ✅ ML_GROUP finds interactions |
| Multi-factor | ❌ | ✅ 3-way correlations |
| Explainable | ❌ | ✅ Shows decision paths |

## Competitive Landmines
- Don't deny they have ML (focus on black box nature)
- Use the 33.3% accuracy stat heavily
- Emphasize IT dependency despite "search" marketing
- Show investigation vs search difference

## The Accuracy Demo
**Most Effective Approach**:
1. "Let's test 3 questions in ThoughtSpot"
2. "Statistically, 2 will be wrong"
3. "Here's the Stanford benchmark showing 33.3%"
4. "Now let's see Scoop's 95%+ accuracy"

## Critical Evidence URLs
**For prospect verification**:
- Stanford HAI benchmark study (search for ThoughtSpot accuracy)
- Lumi AI comparison showing 33.3% vs 95.2%
- Customer forums discussing implementation time
- Pricing discussions showing $140K average

## The Closing Line
"ThoughtSpot gives you a 33% chance of getting the right answer for $140,000 a year. Scoop gives you 95%+ accuracy with full investigation for $3,588. Which would you bet your business on?"
