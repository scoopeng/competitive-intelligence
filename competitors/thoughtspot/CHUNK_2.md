# CHUNK 2: Technical Reality & Competitive Context (30-35 minutes)

## YOUR MISSION
Document technical limitations with quantified data and position in competitive landscape.

## PHASE 2A: Technical Performance Analysis (12-15 minutes)

### Performance Quantification
1. "ThoughtSpot slow performance response time seconds query"
2. "ThoughtSpot memory requirements GB RAM crashes"
3. "ThoughtSpot concurrent users limit scalability testing"
4. "ThoughtSpot database timeout connection errors"
5. "ThoughtSpot uptime downtime SLA breach outage"

**Goal**: Get specific numbers - response times, memory needs, user limits, uptime stats

### Integration Reality Check
6. "ThoughtSpot API rate limits throttling developers"
7. "ThoughtSpot SSO integration broken SAML authentication"
8. "ThoughtSpot mobile app terrible performance user"
9. "ThoughtSpot embedding iframe security CSP issues"
10. "ThoughtSpot REST API documentation incomplete missing"

**Focus**: Real developer pain points, integration failures, technical debt

## PHASE 2B: Competitive Positioning Research (10-12 minutes)

### Direct Competitive Intelligence
11. "ThoughtSpot vs Tableau why customers switch"
12. "ThoughtSpot vs PowerBI RFP evaluation lost deal"
13. "ThoughtSpot vs Qlik comparison customers choose alternative"
14. "ThoughtSpot losing market share declining adoption 2024 2025"

### Analyst & Market Intelligence
15. "ThoughtSpot Gartner customers complain disappointed"
16. "ThoughtSpot Forrester critical assessment limitations"
17. "ThoughtSpot analyst report customer feedback negative"

**Goal**: Position in market context, understand competitive losses

## PHASE 2C: Economic Impact Deep Dive (8-10 minutes)

### Total Cost of Ownership Reality
18. "ThoughtSpot hidden costs professional services implementation"
19. "ThoughtSpot training required weeks months learning curve"
20. "ThoughtSpot consultant fees implementation partner expensive"
21. "ThoughtSpot maintenance overhead admin full-time required"

### ROI and Value Realization
22. "ThoughtSpot time to value months delayed insights"
23. "ThoughtSpot ROI negative failed to deliver business value"
24. "ThoughtSpot opportunity cost manual reporting workarounds"

**Focus**: True costs beyond licenses, delayed value realization
