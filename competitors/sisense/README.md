## Key Differentiators

### 1. The Renewal Shock (Their Business Model)
**Customer Reality**: "400% price increase at renewal time"
- Year 1: Reasonable price to lock you in
- Year 2: Quadruple the price when you're trapped
- Migration cost: €50K just to switch platforms
- **Use these quotes** - from actual customers

### 2. Fake AI (ARIMA ≠ AI)
- **ARIMA**: Time-series forecasting from 1970s
- **Simply Ask**: Deprecated because it failed
- **Reality**: Statistical methods marketed as AI
- We have real LLMs, they have 1970s math

### 3. Embedded Analytics Trap
**They're for ISVs, not enterprises**:
- Built for embedding in software products
- Not for business user self-service
- Compose SDK = developer focus
- Wrong market for business teams

### 4. Hidden Costs Everywhere
| Cost Type | Sisense Reality |
|-----------|----------------|
| Base license | Just the start |
| Data connectors | Extra charges |
| AI features | 20-30% premium |
| Version upgrades | More fees |
| Platform migration | €50K forced |
| Renewal | 400% increase |

## Discovery Questions
1. "What happened at your Sisense renewal?"
2. "Are you using Simply Ask?" (deprecated)
3. "What's the total cost including all add-ons?"
4. "How long was implementation?"
5. "Can business users work independently?"

## Objection Handlers

**"Sisense has AI capabilities"**
→ "They use ARIMA from the 1970s. Their actual AI attempt, Simply Ask, was deprecated because it didn't work. That's not AI, it's marketing."

**"It's a mature platform"**
→ "Mature enough to charge 400% more at renewal. They're focused on embedded analytics for software vendors, not business user empowerment."

**"We need embedded analytics"**
→ "Then you're building software, not empowering business users. Sisense is for ISVs embedding analytics. Scoop is for business teams investigating problems."

## The Price Shock Story
**Real Customer Quote**:
"Sisense quadrupled the price when initial contract ended"

**The Pattern**:
1. Year 1: Competitive price to win deal
2. Implementation: 14+ weeks, deep integration
3. Lock-in: Too expensive to migrate
4. Year 2: 400% price increase
5. Trapped: Pay or lose everything

## Competitive Landmines
- Don't focus only on price (they'll promise discounts)
- Emphasize fake AI (ARIMA isn't AI)
- Show embedded vs self-service difference
- Document Simply Ask deprecation

## Platform Migration Trap
**Customer Report**: 
- Sisense dropped Windows support
- Forced Linux migration
- Cost: €50,000 with no trial
- No choice: migrate or lose system

## The ISV Focus Evidence
- Compose SDK for developers
- Fusion for embedded analytics
- Focus on white-labeling
- Not for direct business use

## URLs for Verification
**Have prospects check these themselves**:
1. `usedatabrain.com/blog/sisense-pricing` - 400% increase
2. `holistics.io/blog/sisense-pricing` - €50K migration
3. `qrvey.com/blog/sisense-pricing` - Hidden fees
4. `g2.com/products/sisense/reviews` - "Scary" pricing

## The Closing Line
"Sisense locks you in with 14 weeks of implementation, then hits you with 400% renewal increases. They market 1970s statistics as AI while deprecating their actual AI attempts. For 56x our cost, you get fake AI and renewal shock. Is that a partnership or a trap?"
