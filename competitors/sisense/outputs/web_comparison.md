### Key Evidence Summary

**Sisense's Documented Limitations:**

1. **ARIMA Marketing Mirage**: Sisense markets ARIMA time-series forecasting from 1970s as "AI." ARIMA is a statistical method, not machine learning. Their actual AI attempt "Simply Ask" was deprecated due to poor performance.

2. **400% Renewal Price Increases**: Multiple documented cases of customers facing 400% price increases at renewal time, with one customer reporting Sisense "quadrupled the price when initial contract ended."

3. **14+ Week Implementation Reality**: Standard implementation requires 14+ weeks with 30-80 hours of mandatory training through Sisense Academy. ElastiCube requires SQL expertise despite "no code" marketing claims.

4. **Embedded Analytics Focus Mismatch**: Built for ISV developers embedding analytics in software products, not for direct business user self-service. Their Compose SDK and white-label capabilities target software vendors, not enterprises.

5. **Performance and Reliability Issues**: Default 300-second (5-minute) query timeouts, mobile app requires weekly reinstalls, memory consumption errors common, and 33 documented outages since September 2022.

**Sisense's Own Admissions**: "Requires extensive training if new to BI" + "ElastiCube not user-friendly, requires SQL" + Simply Ask deprecation = acknowledgment that business user empowerment failed.
