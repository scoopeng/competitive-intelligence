## Dimension 1: Autonomy (3/10)

### Setup (0/4)
**Score**: 0/4
**Evidence**:
- **14+ week implementation** typical (Phase 2)
- "Requires extensive training if new to BI" (Phase 2)
- **Sisense Academy**: "30-80 hours of training needed" (Phase 2)
- **ElastiCube requires SQL** despite "no code" claims (Phase 2)
- Business users cannot setup independently
- IT must create data models before users can view
**Source**:
- Phase 2: "14+ Week Implementation - Standard timeline"
- Phase 2: "30-80 hours of training needed"
- BATTLE_CARD: "14+ weeks typical"
**Reasoning**: Complete IT dependency. Enterprise implementation required. Zero self-service setup.

### Questions (2/3)
**Score**: 2/3
**Evidence**:
- Has natural language capability (Simply Ask being deprecated)
- New chatbot in beta (Generative AI for cloud only)
- "Template-based NLQ, not true understanding" (Phase 2)

- Can ask questions but limited understanding
- Simply Ask being deprecated suggests quality issues
**Source**:
- Phase 2: "Simply Ask (DEPRECATED) - Natural language failed, being replaced"
- Phase 2: "New chatbot in beta"
**Reasoning**: NL exists and partially works (better than complete failures). Being replaced suggests issues but functionality exists. 2/3 for working but limited capability.

### Speed (1/3)
**Score**: 1/3
**Evidence**:
- **Default 300-second timeout** (5 minutes) for queries (Phase 3)
- "Large Data Issues: Response sizes over 10KB cause degradation" (Phase 3)
- Fast for small queries, slow for complex
- BUT: 14+ weeks before first query possible
- Not instant insights
**Source**:
- Phase 3: "Default 300 seconds (5 minutes) for web queries"
- Phase 3: "6-8 widgets recommended for optimal performance"
**Reasoning**: Slow queries (5-minute timeouts) and weeks to value. 1/3 for functional but slow.

**Total Autonomy**: 3/10

## Scoring Rationale: Why 14/50

**Low Score Because**:
- **Zero Excel formulas** - automatic 0/4 on Native Integration (export-only)
- **100% portal prison** - automatic 0/3
- **ARIMA not ML** - automatic 0/3 on ML (1970s statistics marketed as AI)
- **No investigation** - penalized to 1/4 (drill-down only, not real investigation)
- **No schema evolution** - automatic 0/4
- **No writeback** - automatic 0/2
- **No presentation automation** - automatic 0/3 on Speed, 0/4 on Brand
- **14+ weeks implementation** - automatic 0/4 on Setup

**Scores Points For**:
- NL capability exists (2/3 questions - being replaced but works)
- Queries work (1/3 speed - slow but functional)
- Basic interface (1/3 - steep learning curve but drag-drop exists)
- Basic drill-down (1/4 - limited investigation)
- Good explanations (3/3 - standard BI capability)
- Good dashboards (2/3 - embedded analytics strength)
- Good connectivity (2/2)
- Good data prep (2/2)

**Total**: 3+1+4+2+4 = 14/50

**Why 2 Points Higher Than Old Framework (14/50 vs 12/50)**:
- New framework recognizes NL capability exists (2/3 vs previous 1/3)
- Dashboard visualization strength properly credited (2/3 vs previous 1/3)
- But still penalizes ARIMA as fake AI (0/3) and lack of real investigation (1/4)
- Embedded analytics strength acknowledged while still failing on business user empowerment

## Validation Notes

**Score is defensible because**:
- **ARIMA from 1970s**: Verifiable fact - not machine learning
- **Simply Ask deprecated**: Their own documentation
- **400% renewal increases**: Multiple customer reports with URLs
- BUA measures business user independence - Sisense fails on embedded analytics focus

**This is "Dashboard Tool"** not self-service analytics:
- Requires 14+ weeks IT implementation
- 30-80 hours training mandatory
- ElastiCube requires SQL expertise
- Export-only Excel (not integration)
- Portal-based architecture
- Built for ISV embedding, not business empowerment

**Why 14/50 Specifically?**:
- Higher than Tellius (11/50): Better NL (2 vs 1), better dashboards (2 vs 1)
- Higher than DataGPT (12/50): Better NL (2 vs 1), better questions capability
- Higher than Snowflake Cortex (13/50): Better NL (2 vs 1), better dashboards (2 vs 1)
- Equal to Power BI (14/50): Similar category - legacy BI with limited empowerment
- Lower than Zenlytic (15/50): YAML config vs ARIMA fake AI - similar failures
- Lower than ThoughtSpot (20/50): No real ML, worse investigation
- Lower than Domo (25/50): Worse on all dimensions, fake AI vs real AutoML

**Why Category D (Dashboard Tool)?**:
- Requires IT for setup and maintenance
- No real ML (ARIMA is statistics)
- Export-only Excel (not integration)
- Portal prison architecture
- Embedded analytics focus ‚â† business user empowerment
- Better than worst tools but still IT-dependent
