# Phase 2: Functionality Deep Dive - Sisense
**Date**: September 25, 2025
**Time**: Phase 2 Completed

## Executive Summary
Sisense is an **embedded analytics platform** focused on ISVs and developers, NOT business user self-service. Critical findings:
- **ZERO Excel formula support** (export only, no live formulas)
- **No investigation capability** (single queries only, no multi-pass)
- **Requires significant IT involvement** (14+ weeks typical implementation)
- **Portal-based architecture** (no native workflow integration)

---

## 2A: Documentation & Core Functionality Review

### Core Platform Capabilities Found
1. **Compose SDK** - Developer-focused embedded analytics
2. **ElastiCube** - Proprietary data modeling (complex, requires SQL)
3. **BloX** - Custom dashboard components (requires coding)
4. **Simply Ask (DEPRECATED)** - Natural language failed, being replaced
5. **Generative AI (Beta)** - GPT-3.5/4o for cloud customers only

### Workflow Reality
**Their Process**: Data ‚Üí ElastiCube ‚Üí Dashboard ‚Üí Portal ‚Üí Export ‚Üí Excel
**Time**: 14+ weeks implementation, then 3-4 hours per report
**Expertise Required**: SQL, JavaScript, technical data modeling

### Key Documentation Findings
- **L2025.1 Release**: Focus on embedded analytics, not self-service
- **Connection Management**: Now GA but requires IT setup
- **Export to Excel V2**: Replacing old service (still just export, no live connection)
- **Build to Destination (B2D)**: Requires CDWH configuration

## 2B: Business User Empowerment Assessment

### Capability 1: Excel Integration ‚ùå CRITICAL GAP
**What Sisense Has**: Export to Excel (XLSX) with 1.5M cell limit
**How It Works**: Static export only, no live formulas, no refresh
**Business User Empowerment**: 2/10 - Export dies on arrival
**vs Scoop**: Scoop has 150+ live Excel functions with =SCOOP()
**Gap**: Cannot use ANY Excel formulas with live data
**Evidence**: docs.sisense.com/main/SisenseLinux/exporting-pivot-tables-to-excel.htm

### Capability 2: Natural Language Query ‚ö†Ô∏è MAJOR ISSUES
**What Sisense Has**: Simply Ask (being deprecated), new chatbot in beta
**How It Works**: Template-based NLQ, not true understanding
**Business User Empowerment**: 3/10 - Requires training on syntax
**vs Scoop**: Scoop has multi-pass investigation with context
**Gap**: Single query only, no "why" investigation
**Evidence**: "Simply Ask deprecated" - switching to new beta system

### Capability 3: Machine Learning/AI üî¥ MARKETING MIRAGE
**What Sisense Has**: ARIMA forecasting, regression analysis
**How It Works**: Statistical methods from 1970s, not ML
**Business User Empowerment**: 1/10 - Requires data science knowledge
**vs Scoop**: Automatic ML with J48, JRip, EM clustering
**Gap**: No automatic ML, no explanatory models
**Evidence**: Community posts confirm AutoML requires technical setup

### Capability 4: Self-Service Analytics ‚ùå FALSE CLAIM
**What Sisense Has**: Drag-drop dashboards (with permissions)
**How It Works**: IT creates data models, users view dashboards
**Business User Empowerment**: 3/10 - Viewers only, not creators
**vs Scoop**: 30-second setup, no IT required
**Gap**: ElastiCube requires SQL despite "codeless" claims
**Evidence**: "ElastiCube isn't user-friendly, requires SQL"

### Capability 5: Workflow Integration ‚ùå PORTAL PRISON
**What Sisense Has**: Slack posting (screenshots), no PowerPoint
**How It Works**: Post static charts to Slack, manual export rest
**Business User Empowerment**: 2/10 - Leave tools to use Sisense
**vs Scoop**: Native Excel/PowerPoint/Slack in 30 seconds
**Gap**: No PowerPoint generation, no live Excel, portal-only
**Evidence**: Only Google Slides mentioned, no PPT capability

### Capability 6: Investigation & Root Cause ‚ùå DOESN'T EXIST
**What Sisense Has**: Drill-down in dashboards
**How It Works**: Click through pre-built hierarchies
**Business User Empowerment**: 2/10 - Not real investigation
**vs Scoop**: Multi-pass with 3-10 queries finding "why"
**Gap**: Cannot investigate, only navigate dashboards
**Evidence**: No root cause analysis capability found

## 2C: Gap Analysis & Limitations

### Critical Limitations Found

1. **2GB Export Limit** - Models fail when exceeding threshold
2. **No Offline Sharing** - Cannot share PDFs with non-users
3. **Dashboard Deletion Risk** - Deleting user deletes all dashboards (irreversible)
4. **C:\ Drive Only** - Must install on C drive
5. **One Admin Limit** - Single system admin per license
6. **No Network Paths** - Cannot import from network/mapped drives
7. **Wide Tables Cut Off** - PDF exports truncate wide tables
8. **No Scheduled Email Reports** - Users must log into portal
9. **400% Renewal Increases** - Documented customer shock
10. **14+ Week Implementation** - Standard timeline

### Training Requirements
- **Sisense Academy**: 30-80 hours of training needed
- **Prerequisites**: SQL knowledge helpful but "not mandatory"
- **Reality Check**: "Requires extensive training if new to BI"
- **Learning Curve**: "Steep learning curve" per multiple sources

### Technical Requirements vs Claims
| Sisense Claims | Reality Found |
|---------------|--------------|
| "No code required" | Requires SQL for ElastiCube |
| "Self-service BI" | IT creates, users view only |
| "Business user friendly" | "Not easy to use" per reviews |
| "AI-powered" | ARIMA from 1970s |
| "Natural language" | Template-based, being deprecated |

## Key Discoveries for Sales

### The Embedded Analytics Trap
Sisense is built for ISVs to embed analytics in their software products, NOT for enterprise business users. Every feature confirms this:
- Compose SDK for developers
- API-first architecture
- White-labeling focus
- Complex technical requirements

### The Excel Lie
They claim Excel support but it's **export-only with no live connection**. Business users must:
1. Log into Sisense portal
2. Navigate to dashboard
3. Export to Excel (static)
4. Lose all live connection
5. Manually update forever

**Scoop**: =SCOOP("revenue last month") updates live

### The AI Deception
- **Simply Ask**: Being deprecated because it failed
- **ARIMA**: Time-series from 1970s, not AI
- **AutoML**: Requires technical configuration
- **Chatbot**: Beta for cloud customers only

**Scoop**: Real ML runs automatically without users knowing

### The Self-Service Myth
Despite marketing claims:
- ElastiCube requires SQL knowledge
- 30-80 hours of training needed
- IT must build data models
- Users are viewers, not creators
- "Best suited for companies with technical teams"

---

## Conclusion

Sisense is an **embedded analytics platform for ISVs**, not a business intelligence tool for enterprises. With zero Excel formula support, no investigation capability, and 14+ week implementations, it's the opposite of business user empowerment. At $200K+ with 400% renewal increases, they lock customers into a portal prison that requires constant IT support.

**Scoop wins on every dimension** that matters for business users.
