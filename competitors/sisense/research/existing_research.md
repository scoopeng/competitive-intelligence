## Existing Intelligence Summary

### Key Claims Already Documented
1. **400% renewal increases** - Multiple sources documented
2. **ARIMA from 1970s** marketed as AI
3. **Simply Ask deprecated** - AI attempt failed
4. **14+ week implementation** typical
5. **$200K+ total cost** with implementation
6. **Embedded analytics focus** - Not self-service

### Evidence URLs Already Collected
- usedatabrain.com/blog/sisense-pricing (400% increase)
- holistics.io/blog/sisense-pricing (€50K migration)
- qrvey.com/blog/sisense-pricing (Hidden fees)
- embeddable.com/blog/sisense-pricing ($109K-137K annual)
- mammoth.io/blog/sisense-pricing (No transparent pricing)
- g2.com/products/sisense/reviews ("Scary" pricing)

### Competitive Positioning Already Known
- **Category**: Marketing Mirage (D - lowest tier)
- **BUPAF Score**: 12/50 (very low)
- **Fatal Flaw**: Pricing shock + fake AI
- **Market**: ISV/embedded, not enterprise self-service

## Research Gaps to Fill

Based on existing documentation, we need to:

### Phase 1 - Customer Discovery
- Find specific implementation horror stories
- Get actual customer quotes about failures
- Industry-specific limitations (healthcare, finance, etc.)
- Reddit/community complaints

### Phase 2 - Functionality Analysis
- Map actual capabilities vs claims
- Compare to Scoop's Excel engine (150+ functions)
- Document ML/AI reality (beyond ARIMA)
- Workflow integration gaps

### Phase 3 - Technical Reality
- Performance metrics and limitations
- Scalability issues
- Integration problems
- True TCO with all costs

### Phase 4 - Sales Enablement
- Evidence-based BUPAF scoring
- Competitive matrix
- Industry-specific objection handlers
- ROI calculator

## Next Steps
Proceed with Phase 1 Customer Discovery to find specific customer stories and implementation failures that validate and expand on the existing claims about 400% renewal increases and 14+ week implementations.
