# Session Context - 2025-09-25

## Critical Context for Next Session

### What We Just Completed

#### 1. Power BI Copilot Research (41/41 searches complete)
**Phase 1 Complete (Searches 1-17):**
- Found $300M SaaS company with only 12% adoption, needed 30-day remediation
- HIPAA violations, $3.5B in SOX penalties, banned by US Congress
- Documented in main checklist + will need `evidence/phase1_research_library.md`

**Phase 2 Complete (Searches 18-41):**
- Created `competitors/power-bi-copilot/evidence/phase2_research_library.md`
- Key findings:
  - Performance: 225-sec timeouts, needs 16GB RAM, F64 throttling
  - No Copilot REST APIs exist (major gap)
  - Gartner: Only 3% of IT leaders find significant value
  - True cost: $60k/year minimum + $100-250/hour consultants
  - Microsoft admits ROI "tough to drive"

**Phase 3 Pending:**
- Need to complete BUPAF scoring with evidence
- Create sales enablement materials
- Document in `evidence/phase3_research_library.md`

#### 2. Scalability Improvements Applied to ALL Competitors

**Problem Discovered:**
- Phase 2's 24 searches generated too much content for main checklist
- Power BI research was getting unwieldy

**Solution Implemented:**
- Always separate research into phase library files
- Keep main checklist clean with 5-8 bullet summaries
- Applied to ALL 11 competitors

**Files Structure Now:**
```
competitors/[name]/
  RESEARCH_CHECKLIST.md          # Main checklist with summaries
  evidence/
    phase1_research_library.md   # Full Phase 1 research
    phase2_research_library.md   # Full Phase 2 research
    phase3_research_library.md   # Full Phase 3 research
```

### Key Files Modified Today

1. **COMPETITOR_RESEARCH_TEMPLATE.md**
   - Added Section 4: Research Library Organization
   - Updated documentation instructions
   - Now requires separate phase files for all research

2. **All 11 Competitor Checklists Updated:**
   - qlik, datachat, thoughtspot, tellius, datagpt
   - domo, sisense, snowflake-cortex, tableau-pulse
   - zenlytic, power-bi-copilot
   - All now use separated research library approach

3. **New Documentation:**
   - `RESEARCH_BEST_PRACTICES.md` - Captures learnings
   - `competitors/power-bi-copilot/evidence/phase2_research_library.md` - Example implementation

### Important Process Changes

**OLD WAY:**
- Document research directly in RESEARCH_CHECKLIST.md
- File becomes huge and unwieldy

**NEW WAY (Use This!):**
1. Create `evidence/phase[N]_research_library.md` when starting each phase
2. Document ALL research in the phase file as you go
3. Update main checklist with 5-8 bullet summary after phase completes
4. Main checklist references the phase file for full details

### Next Session Tasks

1. **Complete Power BI Copilot Phase 3:**
   - BUPAF scoring with evidence
   - Update BATTLE_CARD.md
   - Create sales materials
   - Document in `evidence/phase3_research_library.md`

2. **Start Next Competitor Research:**
   - Priority order: Tableau Pulse, ThoughtSpot, Qlik
   - Use the new separated library approach from the start
   - Remember: 90-120 minutes per competitor for full research

3. **Key Commands for Research:**
   ```bash
   # Check what needs work
   cat COMPETITOR_COMPLETENESS_ANALYSIS.md

   # View a competitor's checklist
   cat competitors/[name]/RESEARCH_CHECKLIST.md

   # Check existing research first!
   ls competitors/[name]/evidence/
   ```
