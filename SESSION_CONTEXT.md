# Session Context - January 2025

**Last Session**: Deep review and improvement planning for competitive intelligence repository
**Next Session**: Continue/monitor competitor research improvement execution

---

## What We Just Accomplished

### 1. Repository Review
- Analyzed all 11 competitors for completeness
- Found repository is only ~30% complete overall
- Identified Snowflake Cortex (95%) as exemplar, others mostly 15-40%
- Discovered we lost research through over-aggressive archiving

### 2. Fixed Critical Issues
- ✅ Removed inflated $1.6M Snowflake pricing (now $50-100K+)
- ✅ Cleaned root folder (19 files → 9 essential)
- ✅ Archived planning docs to `archive/planning-docs-2025/`
- ✅ Moved templates to `templates/` folder
- ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md with full context

### 3. Created Improvement System
- **COMPETITOR_COMPLETENESS_ANALYSIS.md** - Shows what's missing
- **COMPETITOR_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md** - 600+ step detailed plan
- **execute_improvement_plan.py** - Autonomous executor
- **Shell scripts** - Start/stop/check background execution

### 4. Key Insights Gained
- **Power BI Copilot** - Most urgent (common competitor, only 40% done)
- **ThoughtSpot** - Critical gap (major competitor at 25%)
- **Research Philosophy** - Never delete, always preserve, evidence required
- **BUPAF Framework** - Guides research toward business user empowerment

## Current State

### Background Process Running (Updated Script)
```bash
# Process is currently running with PID 29014 (restarted at 02:23)
# Now includes ALL 50 steps (Phase 7 removed)

# Check status anytime
./check_improvement_status.sh

# View logs
tail -f improvement_execution.log
```

### IMPORTANT: Script Update Mid-Execution
- **Original script**: Only had phases 1-2 (20 steps)
- **Current script**: Now has phases 1-6 (50 steps, Phase 7 removed)
- **Power BI & Tableau**: Completed with OLD script (only 20 steps)
- **ThoughtSpot onwards**: Will get FULL 50 steps

### Competitors Needing Re-run (All Need Phases 3-6)
After current execution completes, these need phases 3-6:
1. **Power BI Copilot** - Has phases 1-2, needs 3-6 (steps 21-50)
2. **Tableau Pulse** - Has phases 1-2, needs 3-6 (steps 21-50)
3. **ThoughtSpot** - Has phases 1-2, needs 3-6 (steps 21-50)

### Priority Order (With Completion Status)
1. ✅ Power BI Copilot (20/50 steps - needs rerun for phases 3-6)
2. ✅ Tableau Pulse (20/50 steps - needs rerun for phases 3-6)
3. ✅ ThoughtSpot (20/50 steps - needs rerun for phases 3-6)
4. ⏳ Domo (in progress - will get all 50 steps)
5. ⏳ Snowflake Cortex (pending - will get all 50)
6-11. ⏳ Others (pending - will get all 50)

### What the Updated Script Does (6 Phases - Research Only)
- **Phase 1**: Recovery & inventory (steps 1-10)
- **Phase 2**: URL verification (steps 11-20)
- **Phase 3**: Customer evidence mining (steps 21-30)
- **Phase 4**: Technical research (steps 31-40)
- **Phase 5**: Pricing investigation (steps 41-45)
- **Phase 6**: BUPAF assessment (steps 46-50)
- **Phase 7**: REMOVED - Output generation will be done manually with templates

## Next Session Priorities

### If Process Not Started
1. Run `./start_improvement.sh`
2. Let it run in background
3. Check progress periodically

### If Process Running
1. Check status: `./check_improvement_status.sh`
2. Review completed work
3. Verify quality of outputs
4. Adjust plan if needed

### Manual Work Needed
1. **Review recovered research** from archives
2. **Verify evidence quality** as it's collected
3. **Web content generation** from research
4. **Testing competitive claims** where possible

## Important Context

### Philosophy
- **Business User Empowerment**: Not features, but what users can do alone
- **Evidence-Based**: Every claim needs proof
- **Incremental**: Small improvements over time
- **Preservation**: Research is gold, never delete

### BUPAF Framework (50 points)
1. **Independence** (10) - Can users work alone?
2. **Analytical Depth** (10) - Investigation vs queries
3. **Workflow Integration** (10) - Excel/PPT/Slack native
4. **Business Communication** (10) - Natural language
5. **Visual Intelligence** (10) - Presentation ready

### Repository Goals
- Each competitor folder properly organized
- 70%+ research completeness
- All claims evidence-backed
- Web-ready outputs generated
- Battle cards current and credible

## Questions for Next Session

1. Did the improvement script run successfully?
2. Which competitors were completed?
3. What research was recovered from archives?
4. Are URLs still valid?
5. What customer evidence was found?
6. Do battle cards need updates?
7. Ready for web content generation?
