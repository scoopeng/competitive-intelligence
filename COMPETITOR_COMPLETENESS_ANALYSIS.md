**Research**: ✅ All phases complete with evidence files
**BUPAF**: ✅ Scored 18/50 with evidence
**Battle Card**: ✅ Updated with capability focus
**Evidence**: ✅ 4 phase files documented
**Outputs**: ❌ No web-ready content

**Key Findings**:
- YAML configuration complexity
- Zero Excel support
- Single-query limitation (no multi-pass)
- No ML algorithms
- $9M funding but zero customer reviews

**DataGPT, Tellius, Sisense, Qlik, DataChat**:
- Each has only 1-2 documents (README + BATTLE_CARD)
- No research depth
- No technical analysis
- No customer evidence
- No outputs

**Particular Issues**:
- **Sisense**: 400% renewal shock needs more evidence
- **Qlik**: Zero adoption claim needs verification
- **Tellius**: Data scientist requirement needs proof
- **Zenlytic**: YAML configuration needs examples
- **DataGPT**: Single-source limitation needs testing
- **DataChat**: Vaporware suspicion needs investigation

## BUPAF Coverage Assessment

### Well-Documented Dimensions
- **Independence**: Most competitors have basic assessment
- **Pricing**: Generally documented but needs updates

### Under-Documented Dimensions
- **Analytical Depth**: Only Snowflake deeply tested
- **Workflow Integration**: Minimal evidence across board
- **Business Communication**: Few output examples
- **Visual Intelligence**: Almost no screenshot comparisons

---

## Priority Actions

### 🔴 Immediate (This Week)
1. **Reorganize Snowflake** into proper folder structure (template for others)
2. **Deepen Power BI** - Most common competitor needs more evidence
3. **Deepen Tableau Pulse** - Enterprise deals need better ammunition
4. **Add ThoughtSpot research** - Major gap for important competitor

### 🟡 Short-term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Customer Evidence Collection**:
   - Mine G2, Capterra, Reddit for all competitors
   - Get 5+ quotes per competitor
   - Document with dates and sources

2. **Technical Architecture**:
   - Create technical analysis for top 5
   - Document actual limitations
   - Verify all technical claims

3. **Pricing Updates**:
   - Verify all pricing (many stale)
   - Document hidden costs
   - Get enterprise pricing where possible

### 🟢 Medium-term (Month)
1. **Create Web Outputs**:
   - Landing page per competitor
   - Comparison tables
   - Email templates

2. **Testing/Validation**:
   - Test top 3 competitor claims
   - Document failures
   - Create comparison demos

## Key Findings

### What's Working
- ✅ All competitors have battle cards
- ✅ All have BUPAF scores
- ✅ Core positioning established
- ✅ Snowflake sets high bar for depth

### What's Missing
- ❌ 8/11 competitors lack any real research depth
- ❌ No competitor has web-ready outputs
- ❌ Customer evidence sparse outside top 3
- ❌ Technical validation only exists for Snowflake
- ❌ Folder structure not implemented

### Credibility Risks
- Several claims lack evidence (Qlik zero adoption, DataChat vaporware)
- Pricing likely stale for many competitors
- Technical limitations not verified for most

---

## Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Focus: Top 4 Competitors
**Power BI, Tableau, Domo, ThoughtSpot** need to reach 70%+ completion:
- Each needs 5-10 research documents
- Technical architecture analysis
- 10+ customer evidence points
- Current pricing verification

### 2. Standardize Structure
- Implement folder structure starting with Snowflake
- Create research/, evidence/, outputs/ folders
- Move existing docs appropriately

### 3. Evidence Sprint
- Dedicate time to evidence collection
- Focus on customer quotes and technical proof
- Verify all unsubstantiated claims

### 4. Output Generation
- Create templates for web content
- Generate first outputs for Snowflake
- Scale to other competitors

---

## The Bottom Line

**Current State**: Repository has strong foundation but lacks depth beyond Snowflake. Most competitors are just battle cards with minimal research.

**Goal State**: Each competitor should have Snowflake-level depth with proper organization and web-ready outputs.

**Gap**: ~70% more research needed across the board, with critical gaps in Power BI, Tableau, and ThoughtSpot.

**Next Step**: Focus on Power BI deep dive this week - it's the most common competitor and needs immediate attention.
