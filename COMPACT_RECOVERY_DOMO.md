# Compact Recovery Document - Domo Research Preparation
**Created**: September 25, 2025
**Purpose**: Enable clean Domo research start after context reset

## üéØ NEXT SESSION: Domo Deep Research

### Required Reading Before Starting Domo
1. **SCOOP_CAPABILITIES.md** - Understand Scoop's differentiators
2. **COMPETITOR_RESEARCH_TEMPLATE.md** - Latest template with Phase 0-4
3. **competitors/domo/RESEARCH_CHECKLIST.md** - Check if updated from template
4. **CLAUDE.md** - Project context and approach

### Key Reminders
- **Focus on capabilities**, not market presence (both are startups)
- **Document BOTH**: Scoop advantages AND Domo's specific pain points
- **Avoid**: Review comparisons, funding comparisons, market presence
- **Emphasize**: Excel engine, multi-pass investigation, automatic ML, 30-second setup

## üìä Today's Accomplishments

### Zenlytic Research Completed (All Phases)
- **Phase 1**: Customer Discovery - Zero reviews found anywhere
- **Phase 2**: Functionality - YAML config hell, no Excel, single-query only
- **Phase 3**: Technical Reality - $9M funding but no transparency
- **Phase 4**: Sales Enablement - BUPAF 18/50 (Category C)

### Key Zenlytic Findings
**Scoop Wins**:
- Complete Excel engine (150+ functions) vs zero support
- Multi-pass investigation (3-10) vs single query
- Automatic ML (J48, JRip, EM) vs none
- 30-second setup vs days with consultants

**Zenlytic Pain Points**:
- YAML configuration for everything
- GitHub required for version control
- Semantic layer complexity
- Analytics8 consultants often needed
- 20-25% manual setup remains

### Template Enhanced
Added Section 0 to CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Required SCOOP_CAPABILITIES.md reading
- Focus on capability differences
- Document both advantages and pain points
- Avoid market presence comparisons

## üöÄ Domo Research Plan

### Current Domo Status
- **Completeness**: ~70% (from previous analysis)
- **Known Issues**: "Portal Prison" concept established
- **Key Weakness**: Forces users into proprietary portal
- **Research Gap**: Need Phase 2 Functionality Deep Dive

### Domo Research Checklist
1. **First**: Copy latest template to `competitors/domo/RESEARCH_CHECKLIST.md`
2. **Verify**: Template has all Phase 0-4 sections
3. **Check**: Existing Domo research in evidence/ folder
4. **Focus**: Phase 2 Functionality comparison to Scoop
5. **Document**: Both Scoop advantages AND Domo lock-in pain

### Expected Domo Pain Points to Validate
- Portal prison (everything in Domo portal)
- No real Excel integration
- Expensive "Everywhere" licenses
- Complex pricing model
- IT-heavy implementation

### Scoop Advantages to Highlight
- Native Excel/Sheets integration
- Multi-pass investigation
- Automatic ML discovery
- 30-second setup
- Works in existing tools

## üìÅ Key Files Status

### Updated Today
- `/COMPETITOR_RESEARCH_TEMPLATE.md` - Added Scoop comparison guidance
- `/competitors/zenlytic/BATTLE_CARD.md` - Balanced capabilities focus
- `/competitors/zenlytic/evidence/*.md` - All 4 phases documented
- `/competitors/zenlytic/RESEARCH_CHECKLIST.md` - 100% complete

### Repository Status
- Main branch: Up to date
- All changes pushed
- 3 commits today

## üí° Strategic Notes for Domo

### Portal Prison Concept
Domo's fundamental architecture trap:
- Forces all work into their portal
- Breaks existing workflows
- Creates switching costs
- Requires training on proprietary interface

### Battle Card Focus Areas
1. **Workflow Disruption**: Domo portal vs Scoop in existing tools
2. **Investigation Depth**: Single dashboard vs multi-pass
3. **ML Capabilities**: Basic stats vs automatic discovery
4. **Cost Model**: Complex licensing vs transparent
5. **Time to Value**: Weeks of training vs 30 seconds

## üìù Session Recovery Instructions

When starting next session:
```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd /home/ubuntu/dev/competitive-intelligence

# 2. Read this recovery document
cat COMPACT_RECOVERY_DOMO.md

# 3. Read Scoop capabilities
cat SCOOP_CAPABILITIES.md

# 4. Check Domo current state
ls -la competitors/domo/
cat competitors/domo/RESEARCH_CHECKLIST.md | head -50

# 5. Copy latest template if needed
cp COMPETITOR_RESEARCH_TEMPLATE.md competitors/domo/RESEARCH_CHECKLIST.md

# 6. Begin Phase 2 research (or wherever needed)
```

## ‚úÖ Ready for Handoff
- Zenlytic 100% complete with balanced battle card
- Template updated with strategic guidance
