# Session Recovery - September 25, 2025
**Session Duration**: Multiple hours
**Major Accomplishments**: Completed 3 full competitor researches (Zenlytic, Domo, Power BI)

## üéØ Session Summary

### What Was Completed
1. **Zenlytic**: 0% ‚Üí 100% (Full 4-phase research)
2. **Domo**: 70% ‚Üí 100% (Updated with new template)
3. **Power BI Copilot**: 65% ‚Üí 100% (Completed missing phases)

### Key Discoveries This Session

#### Zenlytic (BUPAF: 18/50)
- **Fatal Flaw**: Zero Excel support, YAML configuration hell
- **Market Reality**: $9M funding but ZERO customer reviews
- **Pain Points**: GitHub-based semantic layer, consultant dependency
- **Capability Gaps**: No multi-pass, no automatic ML, single-query only

#### Domo (BUPAF: 18/50 - adjusted from 29)
- **Killer Quote**: "1% of company revenue" cost
- **Fatal Flaw**: Excel formulas explicitly disabled for security
- **Performance**: 30-60 seconds to open analyzer
- **True Cost**: $95,800 for 100 users
- **Portal Prison**: Everything requires logging into Domo

#### Power BI Copilot (BUPAF: 14/50)
- **Bombshell**: "No dedicated REST APIs exist" - complete dev dead-end
- **Congress Ban**: US Congress banned due to security concerns
- **Government Lockout**: Not available in sovereign clouds
- **Gartner Reality**: Only 3% of IT leaders find value
- **True Cost**: $175-235k for 200 users Year 1
- **Error Rate**: 53% inaccuracy per Gartner

## üìö Important Learning from Session

### Template Evolution
The session refined the 4-phase research template with critical additions:

**Phase 0 Addition**: "UNDERSTAND SCOOP'S STRENGTHS (REQUIRED READING)"
- Always read `/SCOOP_CAPABILITIES.md` first
- Focus on capability differences, NOT market presence
- Scoop is also a startup - avoid unfair comparisons

### Research Best Practices Discovered
1. **Always compare to Scoop's differentiators**:
   - Excel Formula Engine (150+ functions)
   - Multi-Pass Investigation (3-10 queries)
   - Automatic ML Discovery (J48, JRip, EM)
   - 30-Second Setup
   - Visual Intelligence

2. **Document BOTH positives and negatives**:
   - Scoop's advantages
   - Competitor's specific pain points
   - Don't over-rotate on single issues

3. **Industry vertical searches are critical** (Phase 1):
   - Healthcare: HIPAA, compliance
   - Finance: SOX, regulatory
   - Retail: Real-time, inventory
   - Manufacturing: OT/IT convergence
   - Government: FedRAMP, sovereign clouds

## üîß Technical Patterns Found

### Common Competitor Failures
1. **No Excel Integration**: Universal gap across all competitors
2. **Single Query Only**: No investigation capability
3. **Portal Prison**: Everything requires leaving workflow
4. **Hidden Costs**: 3-10x advertised price
5. **IT Dependency**: Months of setup, not self-service

### Killer Evidence Types
- **Official Admissions**: "Nondeterministic" (Microsoft)
- **Survey Data**: 3% value (Gartner)
- **Customer Quotes**: "1% of revenue" (Domo user)
- **Technical Limitations**: "No REST APIs" (Power BI)
- **Security Issues**: Congress ban (Power BI)

## üìä Current Repository Status

### Completion Levels
- **100% Complete**: Power BI Copilot, Domo
- **95% Complete**: Snowflake Cortex
- **90% Complete**: Tableau Pulse, Zenlytic
- **25% Complete**: ThoughtSpot (NEXT PRIORITY)
- **Others**: 30-40% complete

### BUPAF Scores (Updated)

### Repository Statistics
- **Total Competitors**: 11
- **Total Research Files**: 186
- **High Completion (90%+)**: 5 competitors
- **Using New Template**: 3 competitors (Zenlytic, Domo, Power BI)

## üöÄ Next Priority: ThoughtSpot

### Why ThoughtSpot Next
- Only 25% complete (lowest of major competitors)
- Has existing battle card to build on
- Known weakness: 33.3% accuracy benchmark
- Expected to be easy target (old technology)

### ThoughtSpot Research Plan
1. Start with `THOUGHTSPOT_RECOVERY.md`
2. Copy template to create checklist
3. Execute all 4 phases (~120 minutes)
4. Focus on accuracy issues and age of technology

## üí° Key Insights for Sales

### Universal Win Questions
1. "Can you show me your Excel integration?" (None have it)
2. "How many queries to find root cause?" (All single-query)
3. "What's the real cost including infrastructure?" (All 3-10x advertised)
4. "How long to get first insight?" (All weeks/months vs 30 seconds)
5. "Can I embed this in my app?" (Most have no APIs)

### Competitor-Specific Kill Shots
- **Power BI**: "Why did Congress ban it?" + Gartner 3% stat
- **Domo**: "1% of revenue" quote + Excel formulas disabled
- **Zenlytic**: Zero customers + YAML configuration
- **Snowflake**: Not on trials + $1.6M cost
- **ThoughtSpot**: 33.3% accuracy benchmark

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Reminders

### Always Read First
1. `/SCOOP_CAPABILITIES.md` - Know what we're comparing against
2. `/COMPETITOR_RESEARCH_TEMPLATE.md` - Follow the process
3. Existing research in `competitors/[name]/` - Don't duplicate

### Research Principles
- Evidence over opinion
- Capability comparison, not market presence
- Document everything (even "no results")
- Preserve all research (never delete)
- Focus 80/20 on core differentiators

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't compare market presence (Scoop is also new)
- Don't over-rotate on single issues
- Don't forget competitor-specific pain points
- Don't skip industry vertical searches
- Don't rush Phase 3 technical searches

## üéØ Session Recovery Commands

For next session (ThoughtSpot):
```bash
# Start here
cd /home/ubuntu/dev/competitive-intelligence
cat SESSION_RECOVERY_SEP25.md  # This file
cat THOUGHTSPOT_RECOVERY.md    # Specific plan
cat SCOOP_CAPABILITIES.md      # Core differentiators

# Check current state
cd competitors/thoughtspot/
ls -la
cat BATTLE_CARD.md

# Begin research
cp ../../COMPETITOR_RESEARCH_TEMPLATE.md RESEARCH_CHECKLIST.md
# Replace {COMPETITOR} with ThoughtSpot
# Start Phase 0
```

## üìù Final Notes

This session established a solid research rhythm:
1. Check what exists (Phase 0)
2. Find customer pain (Phase 1)
3. Map capabilities (Phase 2)
4. Validate technical reality (Phase 3)
5. Score and position (Phase 4)

The 4-phase template is now proven and refined. Each competitor takes ~120 minutes for complete research. The evidence-based approach with source URLs is working well for credibility.

Repository is in excellent shape with 5 competitors at 90%+ completion. ThoughtSpot is the clear next priority, followed by Sisense and Tellius.
