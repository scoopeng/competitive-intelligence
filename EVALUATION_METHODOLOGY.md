# BUPAF Evaluation Methodology

**Version**: 2.0  
**Purpose**: Standardized approach for evaluating analytics platforms on business user empowerment

## Evaluation Process

### Phase 1: Existing Research Review
1. **Collect existing documentation**
   - Company materials
   - User reviews
   - Technical documentation
   - Pricing information
   - Implementation guides

2. **Identify gaps**
   - Missing moat evidence
   - Unverified claims
   - Hidden limitations
   - Real user experiences

### Phase 2: Five Moat Testing

#### Moat 1: Investigation Engine
**Test**: Can the platform investigate WHY metrics changed?

**Evidence Required**:
- Multi-hypothesis testing capability
- Probe dependencies
- Reasoning chains
- Root cause identification

**Red Flags**:
- "Single query only"
- "Shows SQL" instead of reasoning
- No context between queries

#### Moat 2: Schema Evolution
**Test**: What happens when data structure changes?

**Evidence Required**:
- Automatic adaptation
- History preservation
- No breaking changes
- Business user handling

**Red Flags**:
- "Reconfiguration required"
- "IT must update"
- "Breaks existing queries"

#### Moat 3: Explainable ML
**Test**: Can users understand HOW the AI works?

**Evidence Required**:
- Decision trees visible
- Rules explained
- Not black box
- Business language

**Red Flags**:
- "Proprietary algorithm"
- "Neural network"
- No explanation capability

#### Moat 4: Native Integration
**Test**: Does it work where users already work?

**Evidence Required**:
- Excel formulas
- Slack/Teams native
- Real-time sync
- Bidirectional

**Red Flags**:
- "Export only"
- "Portal required"
- "Copy and paste"

#### Moat 5: Domain Intelligence
**Test**: Does it understand business context?

**Evidence Required**:
- Industry knowledge
- Semantic understanding
- Smart defaults
- Context awareness

**Red Flags**:
- "Generic tool"
- "Requires configuration"
- "Define everything"

### Phase 3: BUPAF Scoring

#### Dimension 1: Independence (10 points)
**Scoring Guide**:
```
9-10: Complete autonomy
7-8:  Mostly independent  
5-6:  Guided self-service
3-4:  Heavy support required
0-2:  Complete IT dependency
```

**Test Questions**:
1. Can business users upload and analyze data?
2. Can they explore without dashboards?
3. Can they get answers in meetings?
4. Do they need IT approval/setup?
5. What's the learning curve?

#### Dimension 2: Analytical Depth (10 points)
**Scoring Guide**:
```
10: Optimization + explanation
9:  Prediction with transparency
7-8: Discovery with ML
5-6: Investigation capabilities
3-4: Simple analysis
0-2: Basic metrics only
```

**Test Questions**:
1. Can it investigate why?
2. Can it discover patterns?
3. Can it predict outcomes?
4. Is ML explainable?
5. Does it recommend actions?

#### Dimension 3: Workflow Integration (10 points)
**Sub-scores** (2 points each):
- Data flexibility/schema evolution
- Excel integration
- PowerPoint generation
- Collaboration features
- Automation capabilities

#### Dimension 4: Business Communication (10 points)
**Sub-scores** (2 points each):
- Natural language quality
- Explanation clarity
- Narrative generation
- Visual appropriateness
- Actionability

### Phase 4: Evidence Collection

#### Required Evidence Types
1. **Primary Sources**
   - Official documentation
   - Product demos
   - Technical specifications
   - Pricing sheets

2. **User Validation**
   - Review platforms (G2, Capterra)
   - Community forums
   - Social media mentions
   - Conference presentations

3. **Technical Proof**
   - Architecture diagrams
   - API documentation
   - Integration guides
   - Performance benchmarks

4. **Market Reality**
   - Customer case studies
   - Implementation timelines
   - Total cost analysis
   - Adoption rates

### Phase 5: Competitive Analysis

#### Head-to-Head Comparison
1. **Create comparison matrix**
   - All five moats
   - All four dimensions
   - Cost analysis
   - Time to value

2. **Identify vulnerabilities**
   - Where they fail completely
   - Hidden costs
   - Technical dependencies
   - Adoption barriers

3. **Document proof points**
   - Specific evidence
   - User quotes
   - Technical limitations
   - Cost comparisons

### Phase 6: Category Classification

#### Category Assignment
Based on total BUPAF score:
- **A (36-40)**: True empowerment platforms
- **B (26-35)**: Guided systems (currently empty)
- **C (15-25)**: Analyst workbenches
- **D (0-14)**: Marketing mirages

#### Category Validation
Ensure classification aligns with:
- Market reality
- User experiences
- Technical capabilities
- Business outcomes

## Quality Standards

### Evidence Requirements
- **Every score point** must have evidence
- **Every claim** must be verifiable
- **Every comparison** must be fair
- **Every weakness** must be documented

### Documentation Standards
- 4,000+ words minimum per analysis
- Clear evidence chains
- User quotes when available
- Technical specifics
- Cost breakdowns

### Objectivity Rules
1. Acknowledge competitor strengths
2. Document our weaknesses
3. Use verifiable evidence
4. Avoid hyperbole
5. Focus on business impact

## Red Flag Indicators

### Signs of Marketing Mirages
- No user reviews after 2+ years
- Opaque pricing
- Vague customer claims
- No technical documentation
- Marketing exceeds evidence

### Signs of Technical Barriers
- Long implementation timelines
- Required technical teams
- Complex configuration
- Training requirements
- Low adoption rates

### Signs of Fake AI
- Statistics marketed as AI
- No ML algorithms specified
- Black box operations
- No explainability
- Template-based "intelligence"

## Competitive Intelligence Updates

### When to Re-evaluate
- Major product updates
- Acquisition/merger
- Pricing changes
- New capabilities claimed
- Market positioning shifts

### Update Process
1. Document changes
2. Re-test affected moats
3. Adjust scores if warranted
4. Update battle cards
5. Notify sales team
