# Power BI Copilot Recovery Document
**Created**: September 25, 2025
**Purpose**: Resume Power BI research after context reset

## üî¥ CRITICAL: Power BI is Only 65% Complete

### What's Done
- **Phase 1**: 30% complete (5 of 17 searches done)
- **Phase 2**: 80% complete (12 of 15 searches done)
- **BUPAF**: Scored (14/50) but in wrong location
- **Outputs**: Sales materials created

### What's Missing
- **Phase 1 Gaps**: Industry vertical searches (healthcare, finance, retail, manufacturing, government)
- **Phase 3**: COMPLETELY MISSING - Need all 24 technical searches:
  - Performance & response times
  - Memory requirements & crashes
  - API rate limits & developer frustrations
  - Competitive positioning (vs Tableau, ThoughtSpot)
  - Hidden costs & professional services
  - Time to value & ROI analysis
- **Phase 4**: Needs proper BUPAF placement with capability matrix

## üìã Next Session Plan for Power BI

### 1. Complete Phase 1 (30 minutes)
Execute missing searches:
- Search 13-17: Industry verticals (healthcare, finance, retail, manufacturing, government)
- Additional LinkedIn searches for professional perspectives
- More Reddit community searches

### 2. Execute Full Phase 3 (45 minutes)
All 24 technical searches:
- Performance analysis (searches 18-22)
- Integration reality (searches 23-27)
- Competitive positioning (searches 28-34)
- Economic impact (searches 35-41)

### 3. Reorganize to New Template (15 minutes)
- Move BUPAF to Phase 4
- Create phase3_technical_reality.md
- Create phase4_sales_enablement.md
- Apply Scoop capability lens throughout

## üéØ Key Findings to Preserve

### Killer Evidence Already Found
- **"Nondeterministic"**: Microsoft's own admission
- **3% Success Rate**: Only 3% of IT leaders find significant value (Gartner)
- **$67,392 Minimum**: Before any user licenses
- **No Excel Formulas**: Zero support vs Scoop's 150+
- **Single Query Only**: No investigation capability

### Phase 2 Highlights
- NO native Excel formula execution
- Cannot save prompts for reuse
- Regional restrictions (not available in many countries)
- Requires F2 Fabric capacity minimum
- No dedicated REST APIs

## üìÅ File Locations
- Main checklist: `/competitors/power-bi-copilot/RESEARCH_CHECKLIST.md`
- Phase 1: `/competitors/power-bi-copilot/evidence/phase1_customer_discovery.md`
- Phase 2: `/competitors/power-bi-copilot/evidence/phase2_functionality_analysis.md`
- Phase 3: NEEDS CREATION
- Battle Card: `/competitors/power-bi-copilot/BATTLE_CARD.md`

## üöÄ Recovery Commands
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/dev/competitive-intelligence
cat POWERBI_RECOVERY.md
cat SCOOP_CAPABILITIES.md  # Read first!
cd competitors/power-bi-copilot/
# Continue with Phase 1 industry searches
```

## ‚úÖ Remember
- Focus on capability differences, not market presence
- Document BOTH Scoop advantages AND Power BI pain points
- Emphasize: Excel engine, multi-pass investigation, automatic ML
- Avoid: Review comparisons, funding comparisons
