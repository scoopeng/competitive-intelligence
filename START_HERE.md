## 🚨 CRITICAL UPDATE: The Domain Intelligence Pivot

We have shifted our core narrative from **"AI Analyst"** (speed/tools) to **"Domain Intelligence"** (encoded expertise/autonomy).

**Before you read anything else, read these three files:**
1.  **[DOMAIN_INTELLIGENCE_FRAMEWORK.md](framework/DOMAIN_INTELLIGENCE_FRAMEWORK.md)** - What we actually sell now.
2.  **[POSITIONING_GUIDE.md](POSITIONING_GUIDE.md)** - How to sell it ("Generic AI guesses. We know.").
3.  **[COMPETITIVE_SUMMARY.md](COMPETITIVE_SUMMARY.md)** - Who we fight (Generic AI & Passive BI).

## What Is This Repository?

Competitive intelligence documentation for **Scoop Analytics**.

**Core Philosophy**: Evidence-based analysis. We attack competitors on their **Architecture** (Generic vs Domain-Specific) and **Autonomy** (Reactive vs Proactive).
