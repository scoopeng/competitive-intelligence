## Key Principles

1. **Evidence-Based**: Every claim backed by verifiable sources
2. **Quality First**: All research must pass QUALITY_STANDARDS.md before publishing
3. **Preservation-Focused**: Never delete research, only archive if proven wrong
4. **Incremental Growth**: Small, methodical improvements over time
5. **Business User Focus**: Measure autonomy, not enterprise IT features
