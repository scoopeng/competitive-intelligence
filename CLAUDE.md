## üö® CURRENT PROJECT: Deep Competitor Research - Manual Execution

### The Strategy
Execute comprehensive competitor research manually using a consolidated template that produces customer-story-driven intelligence with quantified evidence and maintains a complete research library.

### The Approach
```
Manual Research ‚Üí Consolidated Template ‚Üí 41+ Searches ‚Üí Rich Research Output with URL Library
```

### The Research Process (90-120 minutes per competitor)
1. **Phase 0** - Existing Assets Check (5 min)
   - Check archive and existing research
   - Inventory what's already known
   - Build on existing work
2. **Phase 1** - Deep Discovery & Customer Stories (40-50 min)
   - Customer story mining via G2, Reddit, LinkedIn (17 searches)
   - Industry vertical analysis (healthcare, finance, retail, etc.)
   - Implementation horror stories and switching decisions
3. **Phase 2** - Technical Reality & Competitive Context (30-35 min)
   - Quantified performance data (24 searches)
   - Competitive positioning research and win/loss analysis
   - True TCO including hidden costs and professional services
4. **Phase 3** - Analysis & Rich Sales Enablement (20-25 min)
   - Evidence-based BUA scoring with customer quotes
   - Customer-story-driven battle cards and sales materials
   - Industry-specific objection handlers

### How to Execute
```
1. Copy COMPETITOR_RESEARCH_TEMPLATE.md to competitors/[name]/RESEARCH_CHECKLIST.md
2. Replace {COMPETITOR} with actual name throughout
3. Work through the checklist systematically
4. Build research library as you go (every URL investigated)
5. Check off tasks as completed
6. Can reset and re-run specific phases as needed
```

### Key Files
- **COMPETITOR_RESEARCH_TEMPLATE.md** - Master research checklist
- **RESEARCH_QA_CHECKLIST.md** - Quality assurance standards (REQUIRED before publishing)
- **competitors/[name]/RESEARCH_CHECKLIST.md** - Per-competitor tracking
- **competitors/[name]/evidence/research_library.md** - URL documentation

## Repository Overview

This is a **competitive intelligence documentation repository** for Scoop Analytics, focused on analyzing competitors in the business analytics/BI space through the lens of **business user empowerment**.

### Core Philosophy
- **Business User Autonomy Framework**: Business User Power Assessment - evaluates what users can actually do alone
- **Evidence-Based**: Every claim must have verifiable proof
- **Quality First**: All research must pass RESEARCH_QA_CHECKLIST.md before publishing
- **Preservation-Focused**: Never delete research, only archive if proven wrong
- **Incremental Growth**: Small, methodical improvements over time

## Project Structure

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/                         # Any validation code
```

**Key Innovation**: `COMPETITIVE_STRATEGY.md` allows human strategic decisions (emphasis levels, scenarios, positioning) that machine generation reads to customize output per competitor weakness.

## Competitive Strategy Framework (üÜï September 2025)

### The Enhancement
**Problem**: Generic template missed competitor-specific weaknesses. Snowflake Cortex (NO UI) got same 10% UI emphasis as Power BI (has Teams).

**Solution**: Human-editable `COMPETITIVE_STRATEGY.md` per competitor that machine generation reads.

### Architecture
```
Human writes:   COMPETITIVE_STRATEGY.md (positioning decisions)
                         ‚Üì
Machine reads:  framework_scoring.md (BUA data)
                + COMPETITIVE_STRATEGY.md (strategy)
                         ‚Üì
Machine generates: web_comparison.md (customized output)
```

### 10-Section Strategy File Structure
1. **Primary Weaknesses** - Rank top 3 with emphasis levels (e.g., "UI: 30%")
2. **Key Scenarios** - Stories that expose weaknesses
3. **Talking Points** - What to emphasize/de-emphasize
4. **Content Distribution** - Word count allocation (7,500 words)
5. **Proof Points** - Evidence from BUA scores + research
6. **Win Conditions** - When we win/lose (be honest)
7. **Positioning** - One-sentence + elevator pitch
8. **Avoid Over-Claiming** - Credibility guardrails
9. **Custom Content Blocks** - Competitor-specific examples
10. **Sales Guidance** - Discovery questions, objections

### Example: Content Shift Based on Competitor Weakness

**DEFAULT** (Generic template):
- UI/Workflow: 10% | Excel: 20% | ML: 15% | Cost: 20%

**SNOWFLAKE CORTEX** (No UI):
- UI/Workflow: 30% ‚¨ÜÔ∏è (0/8 Native Integration)
- Investigation: 25% ‚¨ÜÔ∏è (0/8 Investigation)
- Cost: 15% ‚¨áÔ∏è (comparable pricing)

**POWER BI COPILOT** (Cost + Reliability):
- Cost: 25% ‚¨ÜÔ∏è ($67K F64 tax)
- Reliability: 20% ‚¨ÜÔ∏è (nondeterminism, 3% satisfaction)
- UI: 8% ‚¨áÔ∏è (Teams integration ok)

### Key Files
- **`competitors/SHARED/COMPETITIVE_STRATEGY_TEMPLATE.md`** - Master template with examples
- **`competitors/[name]/COMPETITIVE_STRATEGY.md`** - Per-competitor strategy (human-editable)
- **`COMPETITIVE_STRATEGY_FRAMEWORK.md`** - Complete documentation

### Status
‚úÖ Template created
‚úÖ Snowflake Cortex example (30% UI emphasis)
‚úÖ Power BI Copilot example (25% cost emphasis)
üîÑ Rollout to remaining 9 competitors planned

## Web Content Generation Framework (December 2025)

### Critical Quality Standards
- **60/40 Rule**: 60% showcasing Scoop innovation, 40% competitor comparison
- **Mandatory Capabilities Checklist**: 40 items that MUST be included
- **All Departments Coverage**: 9 departments minimum
- **Positive Data Team Messaging**: "We enable, not replace"
- **Competitor-Specific Emphasis**: Use COMPETITIVE_STRATEGY.md to customize

### Files for Web Comparison Generation
- **`WEB_COMPARISON_TEMPLATE.md`** - Base template (150K+ chars target)
- **`WEB_COMPARISON_PHASED_EXECUTION.md`** - 4-phase execution framework
- **`competitors/SHARED/`** - Reusable components library
- **`competitors/[name]/COMPETITIVE_STRATEGY.md`** - üÜï Competitor-specific customization

### Generation Workflow
```bash
# Read competitor strategy file first
cat competitors/[name]/COMPETITIVE_STRATEGY.md

# Then generate with customized emphasis
"Generate web comparison for [competitor] using strategy file"
```

**Output**: `competitors/[name]/outputs/web_comparison.md`
- AEO-optimized for answer engines
- 7,500+ words with competitor-specific emphasis
- Evidence-based, credible, balanced

## Key Principles

1. **Research is Gold**: Never delete, always preserve
2. **Evidence Required**: No claims without proof
3. **BUA Guides**: Focus on business user empowerment
4. **Credibility First**: Better to understate than exaggerate
5. **Incremental Progress**: Small steps, checkpoint often
6. **Build Up More Than Tear Down**: 60% Scoop innovation, 40% competitor gaps
7. **Enable Don't Replace**: Positive messaging for data teams
8. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All audiences, all capabilities

## Current Status (September 2025)

### Framework Redesign ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **100-Point BUA Framework**: All 12 competitors rescored
- **Mathematical Verification**: All dimension sums = totals
- **Competitive Strategy Files**: Template + 2 examples created

### Key Competitor Research Areas
1. **Snowflake Cortex**: Most extensive analysis with Python test suite (20+ files)
2. **Domo**: Portal prison and AI capabilities analysis
3. **ThoughtSpot**: Accuracy benchmarking evidence
4. **Others**: Each with battle cards and specific limitation evidence

### BUA Scoring Framework
- **Total Score**: 50 points (5 dimensions √ó 10 points each)
- **Categories**: 
  - A (35-50): Business Empowerment
  - B (25-34): Analyst Workbench
  - C (15-24): Enterprise Platform
  - D (0-14): Marketing Mirage

## Maintenance Guidelines

### When Adding New Competitors
1. Create folder in `competitors/[name]/`
2. Add `README.md` for navigation
3. Create `BATTLE_CARD.md` for sales
4. Document all evidence with source URLs and dates

### When Updating Existing Content
1. Verify all evidence URLs still work
2. Update pricing if changed
3. Add date to "Last Updated" field
4. Document changes in `CHANGELOG.md`

### Evidence Standards
- Always include source URL and date
- Prefer official vendor documentation
- Document exact quotes when possible
- No speculation without evidence

## Python Testing Dependencies

For running Snowflake tests:
- `snowflake-connector-python`
- Standard library: `json`, `time`, `datetime`, `typing`, `dataclasses`, `enum`

Note: No package management files (requirements.txt, etc.) exist - dependencies are managed manually.
