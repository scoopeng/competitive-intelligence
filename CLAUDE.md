## ðŸš¨ CURRENT PROJECT: Deep Competitor Research with Claude CLI

### The Strategy
Use Claude CLI to execute comprehensive 3-chunk research process that produces customer-story-driven intelligence with quantified evidence.

### The Architecture
```
Python Orchestrator â†’ Claude CLI â†’ 3 Deep Chunks â†’ Rich Research Output
```

### The 3-Chunk Deep Process (90-120 minutes per competitor)
1. **CHUNK_1** - Deep Discovery & Customer Stories (40-50 min)
   - Customer story mining via G2, Reddit, LinkedIn
   - Industry vertical analysis (healthcare, finance, retail, etc.)
   - Implementation horror stories and switching decisions
2. **CHUNK_2** - Technical Reality & Competitive Context (30-35 min)
   - Quantified performance data (response times, memory, limits)
   - Competitive positioning research and win/loss analysis
   - True TCO including hidden costs and professional services
3. **CHUNK_3** - Analysis & Rich Sales Enablement (20-25 min)
   - Evidence-based BUPAF scoring with customer quotes
   - Customer-story-driven battle cards and sales materials
   - Industry-specific objection handlers

### How to Execute
```bash
# Research one competitor (~90-120 minutes total)
python3 claude_research_orchestrator.py --competitor tableau-pulse

# Research all competitors
python3 claude_research_orchestrator.py
```

### Key Files
- **MASTER_PLAN.md** - Complete strategy
- **claude_research_orchestrator.py** - The orchestrator
- **CHUNK_TEMPLATE.md** - Template for chunks
- **competitors/[name]/CHUNK_*.md** - Per-competitor instructions

## Repository Overview

This is a **competitive intelligence documentation repository** for Scoop Analytics, focused on analyzing competitors in the business analytics/BI space through the lens of **business user empowerment**.

### Core Philosophy
- **BUPAF Framework**: Business User Power Assessment - evaluates what users can actually do alone
- **Evidence-Based**: Every claim must have verifiable proof
- **Preservation-Focused**: Never delete research, only archive if proven wrong
- **Incremental Growth**: Small, methodical improvements over time

## Key Principles

1. **Research is Gold**: Never delete, always preserve
2. **Evidence Required**: No claims without proof
3. **BUPAF Guides**: Focus on business user empowerment
4. **Credibility First**: Better to understate than exaggerate
5. **Incremental Progress**: Small steps, checkpoint often

## Current Priorities

### Phase 1: Stabilize Foundation (This Week)
- Fix inflated claims (âœ… Snowflake $1.6M removed)
- Archive planning docs (âœ… Root cleaned)
- Apply BUPAF scoring consistently

### Phase 2: Deepen Priority Competitors (Next 2 Weeks)
Priority order based on deal frequency:
1. **Power BI Copilot** - Most common, only 40% done
2. **Tableau Pulse** - Enterprise deals, schema issues
3. **ThoughtSpot** - Major gap at 25%
4. **Domo** - 70% done, needs organization

### Phase 3: Complete Repository (Month)
- All competitors >70% complete
- Web outputs for all
- Automated updates working

## Common Development Tasks

### Running Improvement Plan
```bash
# Check what needs work
cat COMPETITOR_COMPLETENESS_ANALYSIS.md

# View detailed plan
cat COMPETITOR_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md

# Start autonomous improvement
./start_improvement.sh

# Check progress
./check_improvement_status.sh
cat competitors/[name]/IMPROVEMENT_PROGRESS.md
```

### Running Snowflake Cortex Tests
```bash
# Install required dependencies
pip install snowflake-connector-python

# Run the main test suite
python3 competitors/snowflake-cortex/DEFINITIVE_TEST_SUITE.py

# Verify test results
python3 competitors/snowflake-cortex/verify_results.py
```

### Searching for Competitor Information
```bash
# Find specific claims across all competitors
grep -r "SEARCH_TERM" competitors/

# List all competitors
ls competitors/

# Check evidence URLs
cat EVIDENCE_VAULT.md

# Search archives for lost research
find archive/ -name "*competitor-name*"
```

### Repository Navigation
- **Sales Teams**: Start with `QUICK_START.md` and battle cards in `competitors/*/BATTLE_CARD.md`
- **Technical Analysis**: Deep dives in `competitors/*/research/` folders
- **Evidence Verification**: All source URLs in `EVIDENCE_VAULT.md`
- **Methodology**: BUPAF framework in `framework/` directory
- **Progress Tracking**: `COMPETITOR_COMPLETENESS_ANALYSIS.md`

```

### Key Competitor Research Areas
1. **Snowflake Cortex**: Most extensive analysis with Python test suite (20+ files)
2. **Domo**: Portal prison and AI capabilities analysis
3. **ThoughtSpot**: Accuracy benchmarking evidence
4. **Others**: Each with battle cards and specific limitation evidence

### BUPAF Scoring Framework
- **Total Score**: 50 points (5 dimensions Ã— 10 points each)
- **Categories**: 
  - A (35-50): Business Empowerment
  - B (25-34): Analyst Workbench
  - C (15-24): Enterprise Platform
  - D (0-14): Marketing Mirage

## Maintenance Guidelines

### When Adding New Competitors
1. Create folder in `competitors/[name]/`
2. Add `README.md` for navigation
3. Create `BATTLE_CARD.md` for sales
4. Document all evidence with source URLs and dates

### When Updating Existing Content
1. Verify all evidence URLs still work
2. Update pricing if changed
3. Add date to "Last Updated" field
4. Document changes in `CHANGELOG.md`

### Evidence Standards
- Always include source URL and date
- Prefer official vendor documentation
- Document exact quotes when possible
- No speculation without evidence

## Python Testing Dependencies

For running Snowflake tests:
- `snowflake-connector-python`
- Standard library: `json`, `time`, `datetime`, `typing`, `dataclasses`, `enum`

Note: No package management files (requirements.txt, etc.) exist - dependencies are managed manually.
