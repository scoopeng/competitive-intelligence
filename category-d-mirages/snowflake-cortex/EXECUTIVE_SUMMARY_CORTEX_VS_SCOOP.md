# Executive Summary: Snowflake Cortex vs Scoop

**Bottom Line**: Cortex is text-to-SQL that can't investigate WHY. Scoop is an investigation platform that answers WHY, works in Slack natively, generates PowerPoints, and empowers business users completely.

---

## The Five Critical Gaps of Cortex

### 1. ❌ Cannot Investigate (Only Queries)
- **Cortex**: "Revenue was $X" (what)
- **Scoop**: "Revenue dropped because of payment gateway failures affecting enterprise accounts, $430K recoverable" (why + action)

### 2. ❌ Requires Months of Setup
- **Semantic Models**: 2-3 months to build YAML files
- **Slack Integration**: 2-4 weeks custom development
- **Maintenance**: 2 FTEs permanently required
- **Scoop**: 30 seconds, zero maintenance

### 3. ❌ No Business User Independence
- Always need IT for new questions
- Semantic model updates required
- Can't explore freely
- Business logic locked in YAML
- **Scoop**: Complete self-service

### 4. ❌ No Excel/PowerPoint Integration
- Manual copy/paste workflow
- Hours to create reports
- No automation possible
- **Scoop**: Native Excel formulas, automatic PowerPoint generation

### 5. ❌ Zero Machine Learning
- Just SQL aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
- No clustering, classification, or forecasting
- No pattern recognition or anomaly detection
- **Scoop**: Full ML suite with J48 decision trees

## The User Experience Chasm

### Daily Reality with Cortex:
```
Morning: 30 minutes querying data
Mid-morning: 60 minutes in Excel analyzing
Afternoon: 2 hours creating PowerPoint
Question from CEO: "Why did it drop?" - Cannot answer
Result: 3.5 hours for basic reporting, zero insights
```

### Daily Reality with Scoop:
```
Morning: "Create my reports" - 30 seconds, all done
CEO question: "Why did it drop?" - Root cause in 45 seconds
Afternoon: Strategic work instead of manual reporting
Result: 3+ hours saved, actual insights delivered
```

## The Killer Differentiators

### Investigation Engine (Unique to Scoop)
```
Business Question: "Why did conversion drop?"

Cortex Output: "Conversion was 2.3%"

Scoop Investigation:
✓ Tested 8 hypotheses
✓ Found mobile checkout failures
✓ Identified payment gateway issue
✓ Calculated $430K impact
✓ Provided fix instructions
```

### Multi-Step Analysis
- **Cortex**: Each question is isolated, no context
- **Scoop**: Builds investigation chains, remembers context, goes 5-10 levels deep

### Schema Evolution
- **Cortex**: Breaks when schema changes, manual YAML updates required
- **Scoop**: Adapts automatically, zero maintenance

## The Sales Situation Strategy

### Your Prospect's Situation:
- Data engineers love Snowflake (sunk cost)
- Resist data movement (old thinking)
- Considering Cortex (haven't seen reality)

### Your Winning Position:
1. **Not replacing Snowflake** - Enhancing its value
2. **Not moving data** - Querying in place  
3. **Not competing with IT** - Empowering business users
4. **Not just cheaper** - Fundamentally more capable

### The Three Questions That Win:
1. "Can Cortex tell you WHY metrics changed?"
2. "Who maintains semantic models when schemas change?"
3. "Should analytics cost $100K-250K or $3,588?"

## The Economic Reality

### Cortex Total Cost (200 users, Year 1):
- Implementation (3-4 months): $25,000-50,000
- Annual Cortex add-on: $30,000-100,000
- Base Snowflake costs (existing): $50,000-150,000
- Maintenance (1 FTE): $180,000
- **Total: $100,000-250,000**

### Scoop Total Cost (200 users, Year 1):
- Setup: $0
- Development: $0
- Annual license: $3,588
- Maintenance: $0
- **Total: $3,588**

### ROI Comparison:
- **Savings**: $96,000-246,000 (28x-70x less)
- **Time to value**: 30 seconds vs 3-4 months (10,000x faster)
- **Productivity gain**: 3+ hours/user/day
- **Annual productivity value**: $3.9M (200 users × 3 hrs × $50/hr × 250 days)

## The Technical Truth

### What Cortex Really Is:
```python
def cortex_analyst(question):
    sql = llm_generate_sql(question)  # Text to SQL
    result = execute_sql(sql)         # Run query
    return result                      # Return table
    # That's it. No investigation, no why, no insights
```

### What Scoop Really Does:
```python
def scoop_investigation(question):
    hypotheses = generate_hypotheses(question)
    for hypothesis in hypotheses:
        test_result = test_hypothesis(hypothesis)
        if significant:
            drill_deeper()
            find_root_cause()
            generate_recommendations()
    create_deliverables()  # PowerPoint, Excel, etc.
    return complete_analysis_with_actions
```

## Competitive Intelligence Nuggets

### They Can't Fix These:
1. **SQL Limitation**: SQL cannot express investigation logic
2. **Architecture Prison**: Single-query design can't do multi-step
3. **Revenue Model Conflict**: Per-query charging discourages usage
4. **Semantic Model Burden**: Will always require maintenance
5. **Vendor Lock**: Snowflake-only data, no federation

### Recent Customer Switches:
- **TechCorp**: "Cortex couldn't tell us why anything happened"
- **RetailGiant**: "Semantic models broke every week"
- **FinanceInc**: "Costs spiraled out of control"
- **StartupXYZ**: "3 months setup was actually 6 months"

## The Demo Script That Wins

### 30-Second Setup:
1. Connect Snowflake ✓
2. Connect Slack ✓
3. First insight delivered ✓
*"Cortex would still be building semantic models in month 3"*

### The Investigation Test:
"Why did [metric] change?"
- Cortex: Cannot answer
- Scoop: Complete root cause analysis with actions

### The Deliverable Test:
"Create my board presentation"
- Cortex: Not possible
- Scoop: 15 slides in 30 seconds

### The ML Test:
"Predict next quarter"
- Cortex: Cannot do
- Scoop: Ensemble forecast with confidence intervals

## Objection Busters

### "We want to keep everything in Snowflake"
→ "We query Snowflake directly. We just do it better than Cortex can."

### "Our data engineers prefer native tools"
→ "For 5 engineers or 200 business users? Who should analytics serve?"

### "Cortex uses advanced AI"
→ "For generating SQL. Can it investigate? Can it find root causes? Using AI to write SELECT statements isn't analytics."

### "We've invested in Snowflake"
→ "Perfect! We make that investment valuable to business users, not just data engineers."

---

## The Close

"Your data engineers built great infrastructure with Snowflake. But infrastructure without investigation is just expensive storage. Cortex adds expensive querying. We add actual intelligence.

You can spend 3-4 months and $100K-250K to get text-to-SQL, or you can spend 30 seconds and $3,588 to get actual investigation capabilities that create PowerPoints, update Excel, and find root causes.

Your competitors are already using Scoop to find opportunities while you'd still be writing YAML files. 

What would you like to do?"
