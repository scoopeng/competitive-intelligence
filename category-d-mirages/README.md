# Category D: Marketing Mirages (0-18 points)

**Definition**: Platforms with AI/analytics claims that don't match reality. Marketing greatly exceeds capability.

## Current Members
- **Power BI Copilot** (17/50) - Nondeterministic behavior, fragmented products
- **Snowflake Cortex** (15/50) - Vendor lock-in with 6-12 month migration
- **Sisense** (12/50) - ARIMA from 1970s marketed as AI
- **Tableau Pulse** (11/50) - Not real AI (embedding models only)
- **Qlik Insight Advisor** (11/50) - Can't handle typos, zero adoption
- **DataChat** (6/50) - 7 years, zero reviews (possible vaporware)

## Common Characteristics

### Red Flags
- **Fake AI**: Statistics or rules marketed as AI/ML
- **Zero adoption**: No user communities or reviews
- **Technical failures**: Can't handle basic variations
- **Hidden costs**: Massive implementation requirements
- **Marketing deception**: Claims without evidence

### The AI Washing Pattern
1. Add chat interface to old product
2. Call it "AI-powered"
3. Hide limitations in sales process
4. Charge enterprise prices
5. Deliver minimal value

## Specific Failures

### Technical Incompetence
- **Qlik**: Can't handle typos or plurals
- **Tableau**: Using 2018 embedding models
- **Sisense**: ARIMA forecasting from 1970s

### Market Rejection
- **DataChat**: Zero reviews after 7 years
- **Qlik**: Consultants find no daily users
- **Tableau Pulse**: Barely mentioned in reports

### Architectural Prisons
- **Snowflake**: Complete vendor lock-in
- **Power BI**: Fragmented across products
- **Sisense**: Elasticube architecture trap

## Why They Score So Low

### Independence (1-3/10)
- Complete IT dependency
- Can't function without extensive setup
- Business users locked out

### Analytical Depth (1-4/10)
- No real ML/AI capabilities
- Single queries only
- Statistical tricks not intelligence

### Workflow (1-3/10)
- No integration capabilities
- Export-only mindset
- Break on any changes

### Communication (2-4/10)
- Technical jargon
- No narratives
- Charts without meaning

## Sales Approach

### Discovery Questions
1. "Show me the ML algorithms they use"
2. "Can you find user reviews?"
3. "What happens when data structure changes?"
4. "How long for implementation?"
5. "Can business users actually use it?"

### Winning Positioning
"These platforms represent everything wrong with enterprise analytics - massive costs, fake AI, and zero business user empowerment. They're checkbox features for RFPs, not solutions for real problems."

## The Vaporware Warning

**DataChat** deserves special attention:
- 7 years, zero reviews
- No user community
- No case studies
- Hidden pricing
- Possible vaporware

When competitors mention DataChat, immediately ask for references and reviews. Their inability to provide them ends the conversation.
