# Session Summary - September 26, 2025
**Session Focus**: Deep competitor research using 4-phase template

## Completed in This Session

### 1. ThoughtSpot Research (100% Complete)
- **BUPAF Score**: 23/50 (Category C - Analyst Workbench)
- **Key Findings**:
  - "$500k/yr for 20 people" before it "crashed with all our data"
  - Zero Excel formulas - can't even do VLOOKUP
  - Healthcare exclusion - legally cannot handle HIPAA data
  - 96 CPUs/600GB RAM needed for 2-3TB data
  - 2-4 week setup, not "instant" as marketed
- **All 4 phases completed** with evidence files

### 2. Sisense Research (100% Complete)
- **BUPAF Score**: 12/50 (Category D - Marketing Mirage)
- **Key Findings**:
  - 400% renewal price increases after 14-week lock-in
  - ZERO Excel formulas, fake AI (ARIMA from 1970s)
  - 5-min timeouts, RAM crashes, weekly mobile reinstalls
  - $89k/14 weeks implementation + $25k-327k/year
  - 0.01% market share, 13% layoffs in 2024
- **All 4 phases completed** with evidence files

### 3. DataGPT Research (100% Complete)
- **BUPAF Score**: 13/50 (Category D - Marketing Mirage)
- **Key Findings**:
  - "Rare to adjust" schema after setup (fatal rigidity)
  - Single source only - can't join multiple data
  - Zero Excel integration (0 functions vs Scoop's 150+)
  - Portal prison - no Slack/PowerPoint integration
  - $150k+ TCO for rigid metrics viewer
  - Only 15 G2 reviews (tiny user base)
- **All 4 phases completed** with evidence files

## Repository Status After Session
- **Total Competitors at 100%**: 8 (was 5, now 8)
  - Snowflake, Power BI, Domo, ThoughtSpot, Zenlytic, Sisense, Tableau Pulse, DataGPT
- **In Progress (other sessions)**: Qlik, Tellius
- **Next Priority**: DataChat (BUPAF 6/50 - possible vaporware)

## Key Process Improvements Made
1. **Phase 0 Added**: Now requires reading SCOOP_CAPABILITIES.md first
2. **4-Phase Template**: Fully validated and working well
3. **Evidence Organization**: Separate files for each phase
4. **BUPAF Scoring**: Consistent application across all competitors

## For Next Session

### DataChat Research Needed
- Has basic research showing zero market traction after 7 years
- RESEARCH_CHECKLIST.md already in place
- Needs 4-phase deep dive to verify if real or vaporware
- Expected to remain at BUPAF 6/50 (lowest score)

### Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /home/ubuntu/dev/competitive-intelligence

# Check DataChat status
ls -la competitors/datachat/

# Begin research
# 1. Read SCOOP_CAPABILITIES.md
# 2. Execute 4-phase template on DataChat
# 3. Focus on verifying if product actually exists
```

## Session Metrics
- **Competitors Completed**: 3 (ThoughtSpot, Sisense, DataGPT)
- **Research Quality**: All with 4-phase evidence
- **BUPAF Scores**: Properly calibrated (23, 12, 13)
- **Documentation**: Fully updated
- **Repository**: Clean, committed, pushed

## Important Notes
- Tableau Pulse was already 100% complete (found during session)
- All checklists now include Phase 0 requirement
- Evidence files organized by phase for better clarity
- Ready for new session to tackle DataChat
