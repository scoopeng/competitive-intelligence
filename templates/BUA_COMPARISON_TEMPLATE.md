**BUA Score**: [X/50] (Category [A/B/C/D])
**Target Audience**: Business users frustrated with dashboard limitations
**Content Type**: Outbound marketing, sales enablement
**Length Target**: 2,000-3,000 words
**Last Updated**: {DATE}

## Template Philosophy

**Focus**: Where static dashboards and traditional BI fail business users who need deeper analysis

**Core Thesis**:
- Dashboards show you WHAT happened
- AI Data Analysts show you WHY it happened (and what to do about it)
- The question is: Can business users access this themselves, or do they need IT/analysts?

**Key Positioning**:
- Chat/agentic analytics as THE enabler of business user empowerment
- Depth of investigation > breadth of features
- Self-service for non-technical users (not Excel power users)
- "Ask → Investigate → Act" workflow vs "Build → Maintain → Stare at dashboard"

## Section 1: The Business User Power Problem (400-500 words)

### The Dashboard Dead-End

**Start with the pain**:
- Dashboards tell you sales dropped 15% in Q3
- But WHY did sales drop? Which segments? What patterns?
- To find out, you need to: [describe {COMPETITOR}'s workflow - usually involves IT, data teams, waiting]

**The Business User Autonomy Framework**

Brief explanation of what business user empowerment means:

| Dimension | What It Measures | Why It Matters |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Browse** | Can users explore data without pre-built reports? | "I want to see customer data for myself" |
| **Understand** | Can users discover patterns/insights without statistics training? | "Why are churn rates rising?" |
| **Predict** | Can users run ML predictions without data science skills? | "Which customers will churn next quarter?" |
| **Act** | Can users operationalize insights (exports, alerts, integrations)? | "Send at-risk accounts to my CRM" |
| **Fix** | Can users self-serve when data changes or reports break? | "New field added to Salesforce - can I analyze it?" |

**{COMPETITOR}'s BUA Score: [X/50]**

| Dimension | Score | Why |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| Browse | [0-10] | [One sentence: what blocks users] |
| Understand | [0-10] | [One sentence: investigation limitations] |
| Predict | [0-10] | [One sentence: ML access/usability] |
| Act | [0-10] | [One sentence: operationalization barriers] |
| Fix | [0-10] | [One sentence: maintenance burden] |
| **TOTAL** | **[X/50]** | **Category [A/B/C/D]** |

**Scoop's BUA Score: 42/50 (Category A - Business Empowerment)**

## Section 2: Where {COMPETITOR} Falls Down (800-1,000 words)

**Structure**: Pick the 2-3 BUA dimensions where competitor fails hardest. Focus on the business user experience.

### 2.1 [Dimension Name] - Score: [X/10]

**What Business Users Need**: [The actual job they're trying to do]

**How {COMPETITOR} Works**:
- [Step 1]
- [Step 2]
- [Step 3]
- **Result**: [Time/skills/dependencies required]

**Real-World Example**:
```
Scenario: Marketing manager sees conversion rate dropped from 8% to 5%

{COMPETITOR} workflow:
1. [Describe what user has to do]
2. [Who they need to involve]
3. [How long it takes]
4. [What they can't do]

Time to answer "why?": [X hours/days]
Skills required: [SQL/DAX/Python/etc.]
```

**Evidence**:
- [Quote from competitor docs showing limitation]
- [Customer complaint from G2/Reddit]
- [Pricing/licensing barrier]

**BUA Impact**: [Why this scores low - connects back to framework]

### 2.2 [Dimension Name] - Score: [X/10]

[Same structure as 2.1]

### 2.3 [Dimension Name] - Score: [X/10]

[Same structure as 2.1]

## Section 3: How Chat-First Analytics Solves This (600-800 words)

**The Paradigm Shift**:

| Old Way (Dashboards) | New Way (AI Data Analyst) | Impact |
|----------------------|---------------------------|--------|
| Build report to answer specific question | Ask any question in natural language | No IT dependency |
| Dashboard shows WHAT | Agentic investigation finds WHY | Depth over breadth |
| Static view | Multi-pass analysis (3-10 queries) | Root cause discovery |
| Excel skills required | Conversational interface | Non-technical users |
| Breaks when data changes | Adapts automatically | Zero maintenance |

### Scoop's AI Data Analyst Architecture

**How it enables business users**:

**1. Natural Language → Investigation (Not Just Query)**
- Business user asks: "Why did conversion rates drop?"
- Scoop doesn't just run one query (like {COMPETITOR})
- Automatically runs 3-10 queries to investigate:
  - Which segments affected most?
  - What changed over time?
  - What patterns predict the drop?
  - Root cause analysis

**Example Investigation**:
```
User asks: "Why did Q3 sales drop 15%?"

Scoop's automatic investigation:
→ Query 1: Which products drove the decline?
→ Query 2: Which regions were affected?
→ Query 3: Did customer segments change?
→ Query 4: ML analysis: What predicts low sales?
→ Query 5: Time-series: When did decline start?
→ Root cause: Enterprise deals down 40% in West region,
   started Aug 15 after pricing change

Time: 45 seconds
Skills required: None (just asked the question)
```

**2. Three-Layer AI Data Scientist**
- **Layer 1**: Automatic data prep (handles messy data)
- **Layer 2**: Real ML execution (J48 decision trees, EM clustering)
- **Layer 3**: Business language explanation
- **Result**: Non-technical users get data science insights

**3. Chat & Slack Native**
- Work where you already work
- No switching to separate BI tool
- Collaborative (team can see investigations)

**4. Schema Evolution**
- New field added to CRM? Available immediately
- {COMPETITOR}: [X days/weeks] for IT to update semantic model
- **BUA Impact**: Scores 10/10 on "Fix" dimension

### BUA Score Comparison

| Dimension | {COMPETITOR} | Scoop | Why Scoop Wins |
|-----------|--------------|-------|----------------|
| Browse | [X/10] | 9/10 | Natural language > learning tool syntax |
| Understand | [X/10] | 9/10 | Investigation engine finds WHY, not just WHAT |
| Predict | [X/10] | 9/10 | Three-Layer AI = ML for business users |
| Act | [X/10] | 8/10 | Chat/Slack native, export anywhere |
| Fix | [X/10] | 7/10 | Schema evolution, but still improves over time |
| **TOTAL** | **[X/50]** | **42/50** | **Category A vs [their category]** |

## Template Instructions

### Selecting BUA Dimensions to Emphasize (Section 2)

Pick 2-3 dimensions where competitor fails hardest:

**Browse (Exploration)**:
- Emphasize if: Competitor requires pre-built reports, rigid dashboards, IT to add fields
- Example: Power BI Copilot (limited semantic model), Domo (portal prison)

**Understand (Investigation)**:
- Emphasize if: Competitor does single queries (not multi-pass), no root cause analysis, limited "why?"
- Example: Power BI Copilot (one question at a time), Tableau Pulse (pre-built insights only)

**Predict (ML Access)**:
- Emphasize if: Competitor has no ML, black-box ML, or requires data science skills
- Example: Most competitors (no ML), ThoughtSpot (inaccurate ML)

**Act (Operationalization)**:
- Emphasize if: Competitor has limited exports, no CRM writeback, no alerting, not embeddable
- Example: Power BI Copilot (not embeddable, limited APIs)

**Fix (Maintenance)**:
- Emphasize if: Competitor breaks on schema changes, requires IT for model updates
- Example: ALL COMPETITORS fail here - schema evolution is universal differentiator

### Writing for Business Users (Not Technical)

**Avoid**:
- Technical jargon (semantic models, star schema, ETL)
- Feature lists ("We have 47 connectors!")
- Inside-out positioning ("Our architecture is...")

**Use**:
- Job-to-be-done language ("When you see sales drop, you need to know why")
- Time/frustration metrics ("3 days waiting for IT" vs "45 seconds")
- Concrete scenarios (marketing manager, sales VP, finance analyst)

### Evidence Requirements

Every major claim needs:
1. **Competitor limitation**: Quote from their docs OR customer complaint
2. **Business impact**: Time/cost/frustration for business user
3. **Scoop solution**: Specific example showing it working

### Length Guidelines

- **Total**: 2,000-3,000 words (vs 5,000-7,000 for web comparison)
- **Section 1**: 400-500 (framework + score)
- **Section 2**: 800-1,000 (3 dimensions, evidence-heavy)
- **Section 3**: 600-800 (how chat/AI solves it)
- **Sections 4-7**: 200-400 each (tactical, brief)

### Tone

- **Empathetic**: "We know dashboard limitations are frustrating"
- **Educational**: "Here's why this happens..."
- **Confident**: "Chat-first analytics solves this"
- **Honest**: Admit when competitor is appropriate choice
- **Non-technical**: Business user language throughout
