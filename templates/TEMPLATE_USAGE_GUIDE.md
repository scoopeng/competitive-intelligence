# V2 Template: Final Status & Usage Guide
**Date**: September 27, 2025
**Word Count**: 6,868 words (was 4,906)
**Philosophy**: Selective Intelligence, Not Exhaustive Catalog

---

## What Changed

### Before: Bloated & Rigid
- Template structure had gaps (Schema Evolution missing)
- No guidance on what to include when
- Pressure to include all 42 capabilities = bloated comparisons
- Department/industry sections forced even when not relevant

### After: Selective & Intelligent
- **All capabilities available** as options in template
- **Clear "Include if" guidance** for each capability
- **Required sections** marked with ‚ö†Ô∏è ALWAYS INCLUDE
- **Optional sections** marked with üîß OPTIONAL
- **Selection strategy** at top guides smart choices

---

## New Template Structure

### Selection Strategy (Lines 29-58)

**Always Include** (Universal Differentiators):
1. Three-Layer AI Data Scientist
2. Spreadsheet Calculation Engine
3. Investigation Engine (3-10 queries)
4. Schema Evolution (‚ö†Ô∏è NEW - always required)
5. ML examples: J48 and EM clustering

**Include If Differentiating**:
- ML_PERIOD (if competitor can't compare time periods)
- ML_GROUP (if competitor can't do comparative analysis)
- CRM Writeback (if competitor can't operationalize ML)
- Personal Decks (if competitor requires IT for dashboards)
- Smart Scanner (if competitor requires clean data)
- Progressive Analysis (if competitor has no depth control)
- 100+ Data Sources (only if competitor has <50)

**Department Examples**: 3-4 max (not all 9)
- Pick where competitor is weakest OR Scoop is strongest
- Example: Tableau ‚Üí Finance, Operations, Executive
- Skip departments that aren't relevant

**Industry Solutions**: Skip entirely
- Exception: If competitor is vertical-specific (e.g., healthcare-only)
- Reason: We lack deep vertical expertise

---

## Department Section Strategy

### Lines 1101-1122

**Old Approach**: List all 9 departments (bloat, not all relevant)

**New Approach**: "Pick 3-4 most relevant"

**Selection Guide**:
- Finance-focused competitor ‚Üí Finance, Operations, Executive
- Sales-focused competitor ‚Üí Sales, RevOps, Customer Success
- General BI competitor ‚Üí Where spreadsheet/ML shine

**Template Provides**: 7 example rows with Scoop advantages:
1. Finance: Spreadsheet engine for FP&A
2. Sales: Personal Decks + ML scoring + CRM writeback
3. Marketing: ML_CLUSTER segmentation
4. Customer Success: Churn prediction
5. Operations: Investigation engine
6. Executive: PowerPoint generation
7. Data Teams: Schema evolution time savings

**Usage**: Copy 3-4 most relevant rows, fill in competitor details

---

## Industry Section Strategy

**Recommendation**: Skip entirely

**Why**:
- We lack deep vertical expertise
- Generic "works for all industries" is weaker than focused capabilities
- Adds length without differentiation

**Exception**:
- If competitor is healthcare-only ‚Üí Show we do healthcare too (1 paragraph)
- Otherwise: Skip completely

## Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Identify Competitor Weaknesses

**Research Questions**:
- Does competitor require IT for dashboards? ‚Üí Include Personal Decks
- Can they compare time periods with ML? ‚Üí Include ML_PERIOD if not
- Can they do comparative segment analysis? ‚Üí Include ML_GROUP if not
- Can they push ML scores to CRM? ‚Üí Include CRM Writeback if not
- Do they require clean data? ‚Üí Include Smart Scanner if yes
- How many data connectors? ‚Üí Include 100+ sources if they have <50

### Step 2: Choose Departments (3-4 max)

**Decision Tree**:
- Competitor targets Finance? ‚Üí Finance, Operations, Executive
- Competitor is sales/CRM tool? ‚Üí Sales, RevOps, Customer Success
- Competitor is general BI? ‚Üí Pick where ML or spreadsheet engine shine most
- Competitor targets specific department? ‚Üí Include that department + 2-3 others

### Step 3: Skip Industries

**Default**: Don't include industry section

**Only Exception**: Competitor is vertical-specific
- Example: Veradigm (healthcare-only) ‚Üí Add 1 paragraph showing Scoop works in healthcare too

### Step 4: Fill Template Systematically

**Order**:
1. Fill all REQUIRED sections (including Schema Evolution)
2. Choose 2-4 OPTIONAL sections based on Step 1
3. Fill department table with 3-4 rows from Step 2
4. Verify word count (target 5-7K)
5. Check Quality Checklist (Line 60-69)

### Step 5: Quality Check

From template checklist:
- [ ] Every major claim has supporting table or example
- [ ] No marketing fluff or repetitive positioning
- [ ] All numbers cited with sources
- [ ] At least 10 detailed comparison tables
- [ ] 3+ side-by-side output examples
- [ ] FAQ answers high-intent questions
- [ ] File passes RESEARCH_QA_CHECKLIST.md
- [ ] Capabilities selected based on differentiation (not all 42)
- [ ] Total length: 5,000-7,000 words (not inflated)
