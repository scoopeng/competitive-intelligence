   - Create research/ folders in each competitor
   - Move (don't delete) documents logically

### Phase 2: Deepen Priority Competitors (Next 2 Weeks)
**Goal**: Bring top 3-4 competitors to Snowflake-level depth

**Priority Order** (based on deal frequency):
1. **Power BI Copilot** - Most common competitor
2. **Tableau Pulse** - Enterprise deals
3. **Domo** - Mid-market overlap
4. **ThoughtSpot** - Growing presence

**For Each**:
- Add technical architecture analysis
- Gather 5+ recent customer quotes
