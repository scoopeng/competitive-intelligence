## Update 1: Strategic Positioning Section Added to Visual Intelligence Doc
**Date**: January 2025  
**File**: `SCOOP_VISUAL_INTELLIGENCE_DISCOVERY.md`  
**Type**: Addition only (no deletions)  
**Location**: Added new section at top, before Executive Summary

### What Was Added:
New section titled "Strategic Positioning: AI Data Analyst in YOUR Tools" containing:
1. **Core Identity** reinforcement - Scoop as AI Data Analyst
2. **Business User Reality** - listing actual tools (Excel, PowerPoint, Slack, Google Sheets)
3. **Strategic Application Guidelines** - when to emphasize "your tools"
4. **Time Savings Math** - specific paths and timing for competitors vs Scoop

### Key Strategic Insights Incorporated:
- **Against NL-SQL tools**: Positioned as "DEVASTATING" advantage with specific pain points
- **Against Enterprise BI**: Positioned as "supporting point" with investigation/ML as main attack
- **Specific competitor paths documented**: Snowflake Cortex (3-4 hours), Tableau (2-3 hours), Scoop (30 seconds)
- **FTE equivalent calculation**: 17.5 hours/week/user = 1 FTE for 10 users

### Business Impact Articulated:
- Clear differentiation between "query result in their portal" vs "board-ready answer in YOUR PowerPoint"
- Emphasized workflow interruption cost for competitors
- Highlighted "static exports that die on arrival" vs "live refresh"

### Quality Checks Performed:
