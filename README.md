# Scoop Competitive Intelligence Repository

## 🔥 Latest Updates (November 2025)

### ✅ PIVOT: Domain Intelligence Era
**We have moved from "AI Analyst" to "Domain Intelligence Platform".**

*   **Old Hook**: Speed, Cost, "Your Tools" (Slack/Excel).
*   **New Hook**: **Encoded Expertise**, Autonomous Investigation, "The Executive's Brain Scaled".
*   **Primary Asset**: Hierarchical JSON Schema (Schema v2.8) & Investigation Coordinator.

### 📚 New Core Documents (Start Here)

## Historical Context (September 2025)

### TCO Cost Elimination Framework (Still Valid as Closer)
*   **Concept**: Scoop eliminates 5 of 6 cost categories (Implementation, Training, Maintenance, Consultants, Productivity Loss).
*   **Status**: Implemented across all 11 competitor comparisons.
*   **Usage**: Use this to *close* deals after selling the value of Domain Intelligence.

### BUA Framework (Business User Autonomy)
*   **Concept**: Scoring competitors on how much power they give business users.
*   **Status**: All 12 competitors scored.
*   **Relevance**: Still highly relevant. "Generic AI" scores low on BUA because it requires constant prompting and validation (low autonomy).

## Quick Start by Role

### Sales Teams
1. Read **[POSITIONING_GUIDE.md](POSITIONING_GUIDE.md)** to understand the "Domain Intelligence" pitch.
2. Use **[COMPETITIVE_SUMMARY.md](COMPETITIVE_SUMMARY.md)** to identify which bucket a competitor falls into (Passive vs Generic).
3. Use **TCO arguments** (in `competitors/`) only after establishing the value of Autonomous Investigation.

### Marketing Teams
1. **[DOMAIN_INTELLIGENCE_FRAMEWORK.md](framework/DOMAIN_INTELLIGENCE_FRAMEWORK.md)** is your source of truth for product capabilities.
2. Stop calling us an "AI Analyst." We are a "Domain Intelligence Platform."

### Product Teams
1. **Schema v2.8** (in `/scoop/development/domain-intelligence/SCHEMA.md`) is the technical reality backing our claims.
