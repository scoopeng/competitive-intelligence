## Key Findings

### Market Reality
- **50%** of competitors have fake AI (Tier 1)
- **25%** have real AI but limited scope (Tier 2)
- **25%** have real AI but it's inaccessible (Tier 3)

### Scoop's Unique Position
We're the ONLY solution with ALL of:
1. **Real AI**: Investigation engine, not just queries
2. **True Self-Service**: No IT/engineering required
3. **Complete Platform**: 43+ features vs <10 in competitors
4. **Affordable**: $3,588/year vs $100K+ alternatives

### Post-Setup Advantage
Even when IT connects both platforms, users choose Scoop because:
- **We investigate** (3-10 probes), competitors just query
- **We automate workflows** (PowerPoint, decks), competitors don't
- **We work in Slack**, competitors require portals
- **We save 25+ minutes daily** on reporting tasks

## Research Progress

**Completed**: 12 competitors (80%)
- âœ… All major Tier 1 pretenders exposed
- âœ… Key Tier 2 competitors analyzed
- âœ… Enterprise Tier 3 solutions documented

**Remaining**: 3-5 competitors
