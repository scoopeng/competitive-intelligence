## 🎯 Key Findings

### The Seven Moats (All Validated)
1. **Investigation Engine** - Multi-pass reasoning (3-10 queries) vs single queries
2. **Schema Evolution** - Automatic adaptation vs universal failure
3. **Dynamic Explanatory ML** - ML_GROUP/ML_PERIOD multivariate analysis with J48/M5
4. **Native Integration** - Excel formulas, 30-sec Slack vs manual work
5. **Domain Intelligence** - Context-aware vs generic tools
6. **Time-to-Value** - 30 seconds vs 3-4 months
7. **Cost Model** - $3,588 flat vs $200K-$1.6M with hidden charges

### Critical Discoveries
- 📍 **Zero competitors** handle schema evolution (100% require IT)
- 📍 **No competitor** has explanatory ML (prediction-only or none)
- 📍 **No competitor** has investigation engine (single queries only)
- 📍 **55-443x cost advantage** validated ($3,588 vs $200K-$1.6M)
- 📍 **Snowflake Cortex**: 3-4 months setup, $1.6M/year, zero ML
- 📍 **DataChat**: 7 years, zero reviews (likely vaporware)
- 📍 **Daily workflow**: 3.5 hours manual vs 30 seconds automated
We're the ONLY solution with ALL of:
1. **Real AI**: Investigation engine, not just queries
2. **True Self-Service**: No IT/engineering required
3. **Complete Platform**: 43+ features vs <10 in competitors
4. **Affordable**: $3,588/year vs $100K+ alternatives

### Post-Setup Advantage
Even when IT connects both platforms, users choose Scoop because:
- **We investigate** (3-10 probes), competitors just query
- **We automate workflows** (PowerPoint, decks), competitors don't
- **We work in Slack**, competitors require portals
- **We save 25+ minutes daily** on reporting tasks

## Research Progress

**Completed**: 12 competitors (80%)
- ✅ All major Tier 1 pretenders exposed
- ✅ Key Tier 2 competitors analyzed
- ✅ Enterprise Tier 3 solutions documented

**Remaining**: 3-5 competitors
- H2O.ai, C3 AI (likely Tier 3)
- Akkio, Obviously AI, Pecan (tier TBD)
