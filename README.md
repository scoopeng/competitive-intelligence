## 🎯 Key Findings

### The Five Moats (All Validated)
1. **Investigation Engine** - Only Scoop has multi-pass reasoning
2. **Schema Evolution** - Universal competitor failure
3. **Explainable ML** - J48 unique to Scoop
4. **Native Integration** - Excel formulas, native Slack
5. **Domain Intelligence** - Context-aware vs generic

### Critical Discoveries
- 📍 **Zero competitors** handle schema evolution
- 📍 **No competitor** has investigation engine
- 📍 **40-95x cost advantage** validated
- 📍 **DataChat**: 7 years, zero reviews
- 📍 **Qlik**: Consultants find zero users
We're the ONLY solution with ALL of:
1. **Real AI**: Investigation engine, not just queries
2. **True Self-Service**: No IT/engineering required
3. **Complete Platform**: 43+ features vs <10 in competitors
4. **Affordable**: $3,588/year vs $100K+ alternatives

### Post-Setup Advantage
Even when IT connects both platforms, users choose Scoop because:
- **We investigate** (3-10 probes), competitors just query
- **We automate workflows** (PowerPoint, decks), competitors don't
- **We work in Slack**, competitors require portals
- **We save 25+ minutes daily** on reporting tasks
