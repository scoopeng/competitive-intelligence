- Limited role-based access
- Workspace-level only

### 3. **Privacy Concerns**
- Data sent to Azure OpenAI
- No on-premises option
- Limited visibility into processing
- Shared infrastructure risks

## Cost-Related Limitations

### 1. **Hidden Expenses**
- Capacity consumption unpredictable
- Performance degradation forces upgrades
- No cost controls or limits
- Budget overruns common

### 2. **Scaling Penalties**
- Large jumps between capacity tiers
- No gradual scaling option
- Per-user costs increase with capacity
- No volume discounts mentioned

### 3. **Total Cost of Ownership**
- Implementation costs: $50k-150k
- Training costs: $10k-30k
- Ongoing maintenance: 0.5-1 FTE
- Capacity costs: $262-10k+/month

## Operational Limitations

### 1. **Support Gaps**
- No dedicated Copilot support
- Community forums only
- IT team bears support burden
- No SLAs for AI features

### 2. **Maintenance Overhead**
- Constant model updates needed
- Verified answers maintenance
- Performance monitoring required
- Capacity management ongoing

### 3. **Change Management**
- Every data change impacts AI
- No automated adaptation
- Manual retraining needed
- Business disruption risk

## Competitive Disadvantages

### vs Tableau Pulse:
- Pulse: Integrated naturally
- Copilot: Separate interface
- Pulse: Consistent results
- Copilot: Nondeterministic
- Pulse: No extra cost
- Copilot: $262+ minimum

### vs ThoughtSpot:
- ThoughtSpot: Search-based (intuitive)
- Copilot: Chat-based (learned behavior)
- ThoughtSpot: Real-time results
- Copilot: Timeout issues
- ThoughtSpot: Transparent pricing
- Copilot: Hidden capacity costs

## Microsoft's Own Admissions

### Direct Quotes:
1. "Can struggle to interpret data correctly"
2. "Leading to generic, inaccurate, or even misleading outputs"
3. "Can't guarantee specific output every time"
4. "AI behavior is nondeterministic"
5. "Might time out, resulting in an error"
6. "Copilot consumes significant capacity"

### Translation:
Even Microsoft doesn't trust their own AI to deliver reliable results.

## The Ultimate Limitation

**Power BI Copilot's fundamental limitation is that it requires extensive human intervention to deliver "AI-powered" insights, defeating the core purpose of AI automation.**

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas:
1. **Decision Making**: Misleading outputs risk
2. **Financial Impact**: Unpredictable costs
3. **Compliance**: Data processing location
4. **Operations**: Performance degradation
5. **Reputation**: Failed AI promises

### Mitigation Reality:
Most risks can't be fully mitigated, only accepted or avoided by not using Copilot.

## Conclusion

Power BI Copilot's limitations read like a disclaimer document rather than a feature list. The combination of technical restrictions, behavioral uncertainties, geographic exclusions, and cost barriers creates a product that's essentially unusable for its intended purpose. 

The requirement for extensive preparation to avoid "misleading outputs," combined with "nondeterministic behavior" that prevents reliable results, makes this a high-risk, low-reward investment. These aren't minor limitations—they're fundamental flaws that prevent Power BI Copilot from delivering on its core promise of democratizing AI-powered analytics.

For most organizations, the limitations far outweigh any potential benefits.
