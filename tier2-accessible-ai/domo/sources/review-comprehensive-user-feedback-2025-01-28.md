# Domo User Reviews - Comprehensive Analysis
**URL**: Multiple review sites (Capterra, GetApp, BetterBuys, etc.)
**Type**: User Reviews Compilation
**Date Accessed**: 2025-01-28

## Key Findings Summary
User reviews expose Domo as an expensive, complex platform that requires technical expertise despite "no-code" claims. The new consumption-based pricing model leads to spiraling costs, implementation takes 1-2+ months, and their AI features are "half-baked" requiring significant data preparation. Small businesses report being ignored.

## Detailed Analysis

### Pricing Reality - EXPENSIVE & OPAQUE

**Secretive Pricing**:
> "One of the most common complaints about Domo is their secretive pricing. Finding out how much you would pay requires a conversation with sales"

**Old Pricing (2019)**:
- Professional: $175/user/month ($2,100/user/year)
- Enterprise: $250/user/month ($3,000/user/year)
- **Note**: They removed pricing after this - red flag

**Cost Control Issues**:
> "It can really get expensive if you don't put in the effort to govern your costs...because Domo is so user-friendly, it's really difficult to keep the costs from spiraling out of control"

> "New pricing update based off token usage will be troubling"

**Comparison Reality**:
> "DOMO is very costly compared to other BI tools, especially when you want to have separate user accounts for each user"

### Business User Experience - MIXED AT BEST

**Initial Promise**:
> "I liked that you didn't have to have a developer background to effectively use the tool"

**Actual Reality**:
> "Cards and dashboards approach allows developer/analyst to visualize and analyze data, but business users will find it complicated"

> "Mastering its advanced features (like detailed ETL flows, scripting, or building custom apps) still requires technical knowledge. Without in-house expertise, you may hit limitations"

**Key Quote**:
> "There are limitations to software when its easy to use. Domo is not an exception."

### Self-Service Analytics - POOR PERFORMANCE

**Performance Issues**:
> "Many users complain that the tool is very sluggish when loading visualizations such as dashboards and reports. The bigger the underlying datasets, and the more complex the queries, the longer it will take"

> "Makes Domo a poor choice for self-service analytics applications, such as embedded dashboards"

### AI Features - "HALF-BAKED"

**Critical AI Assessment**:
> "Much like their competitors (like ThoughtSpot), the idea is great but in reality, it seems half-baked. To get the AI workflows to produce the output you need, there needs to be significant data modeling and preparation done beforehand. In other words, your AI needs some data science talent to work for the regular business user properly."

**Translation**: AI doesn't work without extensive technical setup

### Implementation Reality

**Timeline**:
> "As it's a cloud-based solution, Domo's implementation is shorter than traditional on-premise solutions. The timeline could average between one to two months"

**Support Issues**:
> "Domo's support team definitely needs improvement - their response time is lacking and frequently ask for information that has already been provided"

### Small Business Reality

**Ignored Segment**:
> "Domo has been very great for our business, but as a small business it is clear we are not a target or focused customer group. I believe their suit of tools is best suited for medium to large businesses. They will accept a small business but will not give much attention to them"

### Platform Organization Issues

> "It's also easy for the platform to become very disorganized - Domo could definitely benefit from implementing some data catalog functionality"

### Overall User Verdict

**Brutal Summary**:
> "It does not handle complex data queries well, you can't customize visualizations fully for proper data discovery and data exploration and it's prohibitively expensive. To sum up, get Domo if you have extensive experience with data analytics and a team of data engineers on board that can solve any data management, modeling, and visualization problems. Also, set aside a good chunk of cash for your annual Domo invoice."

### Red Flags from Reviews
1. Consumption pricing = uncontrolled costs
2. AI requires data science team
3. Performance degrades with data size
4. Small businesses ignored
5. 1-2 month implementations
6. Poor support response
7. Platform becomes disorganized
8. Need data engineers on staff

### Evidence Collected
- Old pricing: $2,100-$3,000/user/year
- Implementation: 1-2+ months
- AI is "half-baked" without data prep
- Performance issues with large data
- Requires technical team despite claims
- Small businesses not target market

### Cross-Reference Notes
- Confirms Tier 1: Traditional BI with AI marketing
- Similar to Sisense: Complex platform, high costs
- "Democratization" leads to cost spirals
- AI requires same data prep as traditional BI
- Not true self-service despite claims
