**URL**: Multiple sources (Luzmo, Holistics, TrustRadius, BT Partners, Vendr data)
**Type**: Pricing Intelligence Analysis
**Date Accessed**: 2025-01-28

## Key Findings Summary
Domo's consumption model is a cost control nightmare. Real enterprise costs average $134K annually with some paying up to $1.5M. Renewal increases of 1120% reported. Credit system is unpredictable with no forecasting tools. User licenses start at $750/year PLUS consumption credits.

## Detailed Pricing Analysis

### Real Enterprise Costs (Vendr Data)
- **Average annual cost**: $134,000
- **Maximum recorded**: $1,555,000
- **Typical mid-size**: $20,000-$50,000
- **Enterprise range**: $50,000-$100,000+
- **Large enterprise**: "Well over six figures annually"

### Consumption Model Nightmare

**How Credits Work**:
- Purchase annual credit pool upfront
- Every action consumes credits:
  - Data syncs
  - Dashboard views
  - Automations
  - 1 credit per million rows stored
- NO way to predict usage accurately

**Cost Control Issues**:
> "Most teams struggle because there's no fixed pricing tiers, and credit usage isn't predictable"

> "There's no built-in cost forecasting, no alerts when you're close to hitting your credit limits, and no way to auto-throttle usage"

### Hidden User License Fees
**Conflicting information reveals complexity**:
- One source: "$750 per user per year base fee"
- Another: "Unlike Tableau, no per-user charges"
- Reality: Both - user licenses PLUS consumption

### Renewal Shock Stories

**Worst Case Documented**:
> "One 7-year customer saw their renewal shoot up 1120%, with only two months' notice. Worse—Domo said it would be 2240% higher the following term"

**Common Experience**:
> "Some users on Reddit report 2–3x increases when renewing under the new credit model"

### Prediction Impossibility
> "You have to accurately predict how many users you will have in a year and how much data storage, ingestion and writing they will use in that time frame"

**Reality**: Nobody can predict this accurately

### Budget Impact Warning
> "Making the wrong business decisions here can affect your overall profitability as your Domo bills can go through the roof"

### Enterprise Package Breakdown
**$100K-$200K typically includes**:
- Base platform fee
- User licenses ($750 each)
- Large annual credit pool
- Enterprise support
- Governance features
- High data volume allowance

**But missing**:
- Cost forecasting tools
- Usage alerts
- Spending controls
- Predictable budgeting

### Competitive Cost Reality
**Domo vs Scoop for 200 users**:
- **Domo Year 1**: 
  - User licenses: $150,000 (200 × $750)
  - Credits/platform: $50,000+
  - Total: $200,000+
- **Domo Year 2**: 
  - Could be $400,000-$600,000 (with increases)
- **Scoop**: $3,588/year fixed

### Red Flags Summary

2. No cost prediction tools
