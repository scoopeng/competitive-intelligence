## Key Findings Summary
Classic enterprise pricing obfuscation. "Only pay for what you use" with no actual prices shown. The "consumption-based" model typically means expensive and unpredictable costs. Free tier is just a 30-day trial, not ongoing free usage. Red flags everywhere.

## Detailed Analysis

### Pricing Structure Deception
**What they show**:
- Free (30-day trial only)
- Paid (no prices listed)

**What they hide**:
- Actual per-user costs
- Base platform fees
- Data volume charges
- Connector costs
- Implementation fees

### "Consumption-Based" Reality
**They say**: "Only pay for what you use"
**This typically means**:
- Charges for data rows
- Charges for queries
- Charges for storage
- Charges for connectors
- Unpredictable monthly bills

### Free Tier Limitations
- Only 30 days (not truly free tier)
- "One training session" = complex platform
- After 30 days, must pay or lose access
- Designed to hook enterprises into paid contracts

### Enterprise Indicators
**Paid tier includes**:
- "Dedicated account team" = high cost justifies staff
- "Volume discounts" = expecting large payments
- "Custom add-ons" = nickel and dime approach
- "Support packages" = support costs extra
- "HIPAA compliant environment" = additional fees

### Hidden Cost Signals
1. No transparent pricing = expensive
2. "Talk to Sales" = negotiated enterprise deals
3. "Custom add-ons" = base product insufficient
4. Support sold separately = ongoing costs
5. Consumption model = budget uncertainty

### Competitive Intelligence
**From user reports and industry knowledge**:
- Typically $50K-$200K+ annually
- Per-user costs hidden in "consumption"
- Data volume charges add up quickly
- Connector fees for premium sources
- Professional services for implementation

### Sales Process Reality
- "Watch a Demo" = multi-call sales cycle
- "Talk to Sales" = pricing negotiation
- Trial requires full contact info = aggressive follow-up
- No self-service purchase = enterprise only

### Notable Deceptions
> "Unlimited users"

**Reality**: You pay for consumption, so more users = more cost

> "Flexible scaling"

**Translation**: Bills scale up easily, down with difficulty

### Red Flags Summary
1. Zero pricing transparency
2. Consumption model = unpredictable costs
3. 30-day trial not free tier
4. Everything points to enterprise sales
5. Support and add-ons cost extra

### Evidence Needed
- [ ] Real customer pricing examples
- [ ] Consumption rate cards
- [ ] Hidden fee structures
- [ ] Implementation cost stories
- [ ] Renewal price changes

### Cross-Reference Notes
- Identical pattern to Sisense: hide prices, enterprise focus
- Consumption model worse than seat-based
- Trial-to-paid conversion likely aggressive
- Confirms Tier 1: expensive complexity branded as "AI"
