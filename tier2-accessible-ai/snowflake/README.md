# Snowflake Cortex - Competitive Analysis

**Company**: Snowflake (Cortex AI)  
**Category**: Tier 2 - Accessible AI (Limited Scope)  
**Founded**: 2012 (Cortex launched 2024)  
**Key Insight**: Text-to-SQL for Snowflake data only - requires complete data migration  
**Completion**: 85% (needs screenshots)

## Executive Summary

Snowflake Cortex is a legitimate conversational analytics platform that provides natural language querying for data stored in Snowflake. While it offers real AI capabilities through LLMs (Anthropic/OpenAI), it's fundamentally limited by requiring all data to be migrated into Snowflake first. This creates a 6-12 month implementation barrier and locks organizations into Snowflake's consumption-based pricing model.

## What They Say They Are
"AI-powered conversational analytics that enables business users to ask questions in natural language and receive instant insights from their Snowflake data"

## What They Actually Are
A text-to-SQL interface that:
- Only works with data IN Snowflake
- Requires semantic models (YAML) for business context
- Charges consumption credits for every query
- Needs technical teams to set up and maintain
- Limited to SQL-expressible logic

## Product Capabilities

### Conversational AI - Real but Limited

**Cortex Analyst**:
- Natural language to SQL conversion
- LLM-powered (Anthropic, OpenAI)
- REST API for integration
- Semantic model-based understanding

**Snowflake Intelligence** (2025):
- Enhanced agentic experience
- Multi-step conversations
- Action capabilities
- Still Snowflake-only data

### Key Product Limitations

**1. Single-Source Prison**
- **Must migrate ALL data to Snowflake first**
- No federated queries across sources
- 6-12 month migration projects typical
- Ongoing ETL maintenance burden

**2. Semantic Model Requirement**
- Must define business logic in YAML
- Technical team needed for setup
- Ongoing maintenance as data changes
- Business users can't self-serve setup

**3. No Investigation Capabilities**
- Text-to-SQL only
- Can't answer "why" questions
- No multi-hypothesis testing
- No pattern discovery beyond SQL

**4. Consumption Model Trap**
- Every query costs credits
- Unpredictable monthly costs
- Can discourage exploration
- No cost controls for users

## Where Scoop Wins (Product Focus)

### 1. Multi-Source Intelligence
- **Scoop**: Query 20+ sources without moving data
- **Snowflake**: Everything must be in Snowflake
- **Impact**: Months vs minutes to first insight

### 2. Investigation Engine vs Query Engine
- **Scoop**: Multi-step reasoning, hypothesis testing
- **Snowflake**: Single SQL queries only
- **Example**: "Why did sales drop?" - We investigate, they error

### 3. No Prerequisites
- **Scoop**: Works with raw data immediately
- **Snowflake**: Requires semantic models first
- **Impact**: Business users truly self-serve

### 4. Native Platform Experience
- **Scoop**: Native Slack, no custom development
- **Snowflake**: Must build custom integrations
- **Impact**: Adoption where users work

### 5. Complete Analytics Platform
- **Scoop**: ML analysis, predictions, clustering built-in
- **Snowflake**: SQL queries only
- **Impact**: One platform vs many tools

## Technical Architecture Comparison

### Data Architecture
| Aspect | Snowflake | Scoop |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Data Location | Must migrate to Snowflake | Query in place |
| Sources | Snowflake only | 20+ native connectors |
| Setup Time | 6-12 months | 30 seconds |
| Maintenance | Ongoing ETL | None |

### AI Capabilities
| Feature | Snowflake | Scoop |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Text-to-SQL | ✓ | ✓ |
| Investigation Engine | ✗ | ✓ |
| ML Analysis | ✗ | ✓ |
| Pattern Discovery | ✗ | ✓ |
| Multi-hypothesis | ✗ | ✓ |

## Customer Decision Factors

### When They Choose Snowflake
- Already migrated all data to Snowflake
- Snowflake-centric data strategy
- Have technical teams for semantic models
- Willing to pay consumption costs

### When They Choose Scoop
- Data lives in multiple systems
- Need insights quickly (not in 6 months)
- Business users need true self-service
- Want predictable costs
- Need investigation beyond queries

## Real Customer Example: Snyk

**Their Implementation**:
- Built custom Slack bot using Cortex
- 2,500 queries/month
- Saves 1,250 hours
- **Key**: Required Snowflake migration first

**What This Reveals**:
- Powerful IF you're all-in on Snowflake
- Requires significant development
- Not out-of-the-box solution
- Technical team dependency

## Sales Positioning

### Discovery Questions
1. "How much of your data is already in Snowflake?"
2. "Do you have resources to build semantic models?"
3. "How do you handle multi-source analysis?"
4. "What's your timeline for insights - months or days?"
5. "Can you predict your monthly analytics costs?"

### Objection Handling

**"But Snowflake has strong AI capabilities"**
- "Yes, for data already in Snowflake. How long will it take to migrate your Salesforce, HubSpot, and Google Analytics data? With Scoop, you're analyzing in 30 seconds."

**"We're already using Snowflake"**
- "Great! Scoop can query your Snowflake data AND your other sources without migration. Why limit insights to one system?"

**"Snowflake is enterprise-grade"**
- "Absolutely. But do your business users need investigation capabilities beyond SQL? Can Snowflake tell you WHY metrics changed?"

## Competitive Reality

**Snowflake Cortex is strong for**:
- Organizations 100% on Snowflake
- Simple SQL-answerable questions
- Technical teams who like control

**But fundamentally limited by**:
- Single-source architecture
- SQL-only logic
- Semantic model requirements
- Consumption pricing model

**Scoop's Advantage**: We're not competing on who has better text-to-SQL. We're competing on who can actually investigate and answer business questions across all your data, immediately, without prerequisites.

## Post-Setup Reality: Why Users Choose Scoop Daily

Even when IT has connected both Snowflake Cortex and Scoop:

### Daily User Experience
**Morning Analytics**:
- **Snowflake**: Open console → Write query → Copy results → Paste to report
- **Scoop**: "run my morning deck" in Slack → PowerPoint ready in 60 seconds

**Investigation Needs**:
- **Snowflake**: "Why did revenue drop?" → SQL error or single metric
- **Scoop**: Same question → 8 hypotheses tested, root cause identified

**Business Utility**:
- **Snowflake**: Query → Manual export → Manual visualization
- **Scoop**: Query → Save → Add to deck → Auto PowerPoint → Share

### Feature Comparison Post-Setup

| Daily Task | Snowflake Cortex | Scoop |
|------------|------------------|--------|
| Run morning reports | Manual, one by one | "run my deck" |
| Export to Excel | Copy/paste or API | One-click button |
| Create presentations | Screenshot charts | Auto PowerPoint |
| Save common queries | Write SQL views | "save as monthly sales" |
| Share with team | Send SQL/links | Share saved queries |
| Work in Slack | Build custom bot | Native experience |
| Investigate issues | Single queries | Multi-hypothesis engine |
| Track changes | Manual comparison | "what changed?" |

### Why Eventbrite Evaluates Both

They recognize that even with Snowflake:
- Business users need investigation, not just queries
- Slack integration matters for adoption
- Multi-source analysis still required
- PowerPoint automation saves hours
- True self-service beyond IT setup

## Bottom Line for Positioning

Snowflake Cortex is a solid text-to-SQL tool for Snowflake data. But it's like having a brilliant analyst who can only look at one filing cabinet. Scoop is the analyst who can investigate across your entire business, discover patterns, test hypotheses, and explain what's really happening - not just run queries.

**Post-Setup Truth**: Even when both are connected, users choose Scoop because we don't just query data - we understand it, investigate it, and package it for business consumption.
