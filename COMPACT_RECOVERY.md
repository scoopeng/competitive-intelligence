# Compact Recovery Document - September 25, 2025 Evening

## üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS
1. **Execute Zenlytic Phase 3 & 4** to complete research
2. Review other competitors needing Phase 2 Functionality Deep Dive

## üìä Today's Accomplishments

### Enhanced Research Template - NEW Phase 2 Added
- Added **Phase 2: Functionality Deep Dive** (15 searches)
- Focuses on comparing competitor capabilities against Scoop's differentiators:
  - Excel Formula Engine (150+ functions)
  - Automatic ML Discovery (J48, JRip, EM Clustering)
  - Multi-Pass Investigation (3-10 queries)
  - Visual Intelligence (AI presentations)
  - 30-Second Workflow Integration
- Applied to all 11 competitor templates

### Competitors Completed Today

#### Power BI Copilot ‚úÖ
- **Phase 1**: Customer Discovery (12% adoption, HIPAA risks)
- **Phase 2**: ZERO Excel formulas, cannot investigate "why"
- **Key Finding**: Only 3% of IT leaders find value (Gartner)

#### Tableau Pulse ‚úÖ
- **Phase 1**: Already done
- **Phase 2**: ZERO Excel support, time-series prison
- **Key Finding**: PowerPoint requires third-party Rollstack

#### Zenlytic (Partial) ‚è≥
- **Phase 1**: ZERO independent reviews found
- **Phase 2**: YAML engineering required, no Excel
- **Key Finding**: Ghost town on G2/Reddit despite $9M funding
- **TODO**: Need Phase 3 & 4 execution

## üî¥ Critical Discoveries

### Universal Gaps Found
1. **ZERO Excel Support** in Power BI Copilot, Tableau Pulse, Zenlytic
2. **No Multi-Pass Investigation** - all do single query only
3. **No Automatic ML** - despite AI marketing claims
4. **Workflow Integration Gaps** - poor/no PowerPoint, limited Slack

## üìÅ Key Files for Reference

### Templates
- `/COMPETITOR_RESEARCH_TEMPLATE.md` - Master template with Phase 2
- All 11 competitor checklists updated

### Evidence Files Created
- `competitors/power-bi-copilot/evidence/phase1_customer_discovery.md`
- `competitors/power-bi-copilot/evidence/phase2_functionality_analysis.md`
- `competitors/tableau-pulse/evidence/phase2_functionality_analysis.md`
- `competitors/zenlytic/evidence/phase1_customer_discovery.md`
- `competitors/zenlytic/evidence/phase2_functionality_analysis.md`

## üöÄ Next Session Plan

### 1. Complete Zenlytic Research
```bash
# Navigate to Zenlytic
cd /home/ubuntu/dev/competitive-intelligence/competitors/zenlytic

# Check current status
cat RESEARCH_CHECKLIST.md | grep "Phase 3\|Phase 4"

# Execute Phase 3: Technical Reality (24 searches)
# Execute Phase 4: Sales Enablement
```

### 2. Priority Competitors Needing Phase 2
Based on deal frequency:
1. **ThoughtSpot** - 25% complete, needs Phase 2
2. **Domo** - 70% complete, needs Phase 2
3. **Sisense** - Needs Phase 2
4. **Qlik** - Needs Phase 2

### 3. Validate Phase 2 Findings
For each competitor with Phase 2 complete:
- Ensure Excel support documented
- ML capabilities assessed
- Investigation depth evaluated
- Workflow integration checked
- Business user readiness scored

## üí° Strategic Insights

### Scoop's Moat is Real
Every competitor analyzed today has:
- **NO Excel formula support** (vs Scoop's 150+)
- **NO multi-pass investigation** (vs Scoop's 3-10)
- **NO automatic ML** (vs Scoop's J48, JRip, EM)

### Market Reality
- Power BI Copilot: 97% failure rate
- Tableau Pulse: Time-series prison
- Zenlytic: YAML engineering nightmare
- All require IT dependency vs Scoop's 30-second setup

## üîß Technical Notes

### Repository Status
- Main branch up to date
- All changes pushed to origin
- 3 commits today documenting research

### BUPAF Scores Updated
- Power BI Copilot: 14/50 (Category D)
- Tableau Pulse: 21/50 (Category C)
- Zenlytic: 18/50 (Category C)

## üìù Recovery Instructions

When starting next session:
1. Read this document
2. Navigate to Zenlytic directory
3. Execute Phase 3 & 4 searches
4. Update BATTLE_CARD if needed
5. Move to next priority competitor
