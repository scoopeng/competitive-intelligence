# Competitive Landscape: The Rise of Domain Intelligence
**Market Analysis - Q4 2025**

## 1. The New Market Map

The analytics market is no longer just about "visualization" vs. "AI." It has fractured into three distinct architectures. Scoop stands alone in the third category.

| Category | **1. Passive BI & Legacy Tools** | **2. Generic AI (Copilots & Analysts)** | **3. Domain Intelligence (Scoop)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Examples** | Power BI, Tableau, Looker, Sisense | Snowflake Cortex, Copilot, ThoughtSpot, DataGPT | **Scoop Analytics** |
| **Core Mechanic** | **Manual Visualization** | **Text-to-SQL Translation** | **Autonomous Investigation** |
| **User Role** | "Miner" (Digs for answers) | "Prompter" (Asks single questions) | **"Reviewer" (Receives Root Cause Analysis)** |
| **Business Logic** | Trapped in dashboards/heads | Guesswork (LLM Probability) | **Encoded in Schema (Explicit Rules)** |
| **Reliability** | High (but manual) | Low (Hallucination Risk) | **High (Deterministic State Machine)** |
| **Workflow** | **Portal Prison** (Separate App) | **Chatbot Silo** (Separate Tab) | **True Integration** (Excel, Slack, Slides) |
| **Value** | Monitoring Status | Ad-hoc Queries ("What happened?") | **Scaling Expertise ("Why? & What now?")** |

## 2. The Core Architectural Advantages (The "Scoop Stack")

We win because our architecture is fundamentally different. We don't just "add AI" to a dashboard; we operationalize expertise.

1.  **The Investigation Coordinator**: A cloud-native state machine that autonomously executes multi-step investigations (3-10 queries), testing hypotheses to find root causes. It doesn't just retrieve data; it *thinks* through the problem.
2.  **Encoded Expertise (Schema v2.8)**: We explicitly define business logic, metrics, and relationships in a readable JSON format. This eliminates hallucinations and ensures the AI "knows" the business like a tenured analyst.
3.  **True Workflow Integration**:
    *   **Spreadsheet Calculation Engine**: 150+ native Excel functions (VLOOKUP, SUMIFS) connected to live data. We enhance Excel, we don't replace it.
    *   **Automated Presentation Generation**: Instantly turn analysis into branded, executive-ready slide decks.
    *   **Native Slack/Teams**: Intelligence delivered where the conversation happens.
4.  **Cloud-Native Reliability**: A robust, scalable architecture that avoids the "hangs and crashes" of legacy on-prem/hybrid adaptations (like Tellius).

## 3. Detailed Competitor Grouping & Strategy

### A. The "Hallucination Engines" (Snowflake Cortex, Microsoft Copilot)
**What They Are**: Generic LLMs wrapped around SQL generators.
**Primary Weakness**: **Context Blindness**. They don't know *your* business definitions. They guess based on column names.
**The Scoop Kill Shot**: **Encoded Expertise**. "They guess what 'Churn' means. We have the exact definition encoded. Watch us find the *why* while they still try to write the SQL."
**Win Condition**: When accuracy and specific business context are non-negotiable.

### B. The "Passive Dashboards" (Power BI, Tableau, Looker, Sisense, Domo)
**What They Are**: Visualization tools requiring manual filtering and interpretation.
**Primary Weakness**: **The "So What?" Gap**. They show a dip in the line but offer no explanation. They rely on "mining" by humans.
**The Scoop Kill Shot**: **Autonomous Investigation**. "Your dashboard shows revenue is down. Scoop tells you *why* (Enterprise deal slippage) and *what to do* (Focus on Q4 pipeline) without you clicking a single filter."
**Win Condition**: When executives are tired of "dashboard fatigue" and want answers pushed to them.

### C. The "Workflow Destroyers" (Tellius, DataChat, Qlik, Sisense)
**What They Are**: Platforms that demand you abandon your existing tools (Excel, PowerPoint) for their proprietary "walled garden."
**Primary Weakness**: **Workflow Destruction**. They force behavior change, leading to low adoption and lost productivity.
**The Scoop Kill Shot**: **True Workflow Integration**. "Don't throw away your Excel skills. Enhance them. Use Scoop directly in your spreadsheet and generate slides automatically. We meet you where you work."
**Win Condition**: When the user base lives in Excel and refuses to learn a new complex tool.

### D. The "Search Bars" (ThoughtSpot, Zenlytic, DataGPT)
**What They Are**: "Google for your Data." Good for "What" questions, bad for "Why."
**Primary Weakness**: **The Intelligence Ceiling**. They translate a question into *one* query. They cannot perform multi-step reasoning or hypothesis testing.
**The Scoop Kill Shot**: **The Investigation Coordinator**. "A search bar gives you a number. An Analyst gives you a briefing. Scoop is the Analyst. We run 10 queries to answer your one question, checking every angle."
**Win Condition**: When the business needs deep diagnostics, not just faster reporting.

## 4. Summary for Sales: The Domain Intelligence Pitch

"Most tools give you a **dashboard** to stare at or a **search bar** to guess with.
Scoop gives you **Domain Intelligence**.
We **encode your expertise** so the AI understands your business.
We **autonomously investigate** root causes so you don't have to dig.
And we **integrate directly** into Excel, Slack, and PowerPoint so you never break your flow.
We don't just show you the data; we tell you what it means."
