## Conclusions from Sources

Based on all sources reviewed, Zenlytic is clearly positioned as an enterprise tool requiring significant technical resources, despite marketing claims of being "for business users." The YAML configuration requirement alone creates an insurmountable barrier for non-technical users, confirming its classification as a Tier 3 AI Pretender.
