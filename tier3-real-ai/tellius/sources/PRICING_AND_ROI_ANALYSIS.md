## ROI Analysis

### Success Case: Pharmacyclics (AbbVie)

#### Measurable Returns:
- **Time Savings**: 10x faster insights
- **Analyst Hours**: 180 hours saved annually per analyst
- **System Consolidation**: Reduced from 4 to 1 system
- **Previous Timeline**: 4-6 weeks → Same day

Total Annual Benefit:                 $870,000

Against Annual Cost of:               $300,000
ROI:                                 190% first year
```

### Typical ROI Timeline

#### Months 1-3: Implementation
- Negative ROI (costs only)
- Learning curve impact
- Productivity dip

#### Months 4-6: Early Adoption  
- First insights generated
- Power users productive
- Initial time savings

#### Months 7-12: Growing Returns
- Broader adoption
- Process improvements
- Measurable efficiency gains

#### Year 2+: Full ROI

### Large Organization (500 users):
- **Annual Cost**: ~$500,000
- **Required Savings**: $42,000/month

## The Enterprise Trap

### Why $100K+ Pricing Persists:

1. **Enterprise Sales Model**
   - High touch sales process
   - Long sales cycles
   - Large deal sizes
   - Account management costs

2. **Support Requirements**
   - 24/7 availability
   - Dedicated resources
   - Custom solutions
   - SLA commitments

3. **Technology Costs**
   - Real AI is expensive
   - Infrastructure requirements
   - Continuous development
   - Security compliance

4. **Market Positioning**
   - Premium = Perceived value
   - Enterprise credibility
   - Funding expectations
   - Competitive dynamics

## Conclusion

Tellius pricing reflects the reality of enterprise AI analytics: powerful capabilities come with enterprise costs. While ROI is achievable for large, data-mature organizations with complex use cases, the total cost of ownership places it beyond reach for most businesses.

**Key Insight**: The $100K+ price point isn't arbitrary—it reflects the true cost of delivering sophisticated AI analytics with enterprise support. However, this pricing model inherently limits accessibility, creating opportunity for solutions that can deliver 80% of the value at 20% of the cost.

**ROI Reality**: Success requires not just budget, but organizational readiness, data maturity, and long-term commitment. For most organizations, the combination of high costs and implementation complexity makes achieving positive ROI a significant challenge.
