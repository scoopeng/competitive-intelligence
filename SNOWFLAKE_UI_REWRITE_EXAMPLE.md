# Scoop vs Snowflake Cortex: Complete Comparison

**Last Updated**: September 27, 2025
**BUA Score**: Snowflake Cortex 26/100 (26%, Category C - Weak)

## 1. BUSINESS USER EXPERIENCE

### The Fundamental Question: Where Do Business Users Actually Work?

Business users don't sit in data warehouses. They work in Slack, Excel, and PowerPoint. They check their phones 96 times per day. They need insights NOW, not after logging into a SQL console.

**Snowflake Cortex forces business users into a data engineering tool.**
**Scoop brings analytics to where business users already work.**

#### Experience Comparison Table

| Where You Work | Snowflake Cortex | Scoop | Business Impact |
|----------------|------------------|-------|-----------------|
| **Primary Interface** | Snowflake console (data engineer tool) | Slack (where teams already work) | Zero context switching |
| **Access Method** | VPN + 2FA login | Already logged in | Instant access |
| **Device Support** | Desktop only | Desktop, tablet, phone (Slack mobile) | Executive responsiveness |
| **Mobile Experience** | None (API requires development) | Full functionality in Slack mobile app | Work from anywhere |
| **Context Switching** | Must leave workflow | Stay in conversation | Maintain focus |
| **Portal Dependency** | 100% trapped in Snowflake | 0% - works in your tools | Workflow integration |
| **Learning Curve** | Learn Snowflake console navigation | Use Slack you already know | Zero training |

**Key Insight**: Business users spend 4.5 hours per day in Slack (2024 State of Work report). Snowflake Cortex forces them to leave their workflow and enter a data engineering console. Scoop brings analytics to where work actually happens.

### 1.2 How You Interact: SQL Console vs Natural Conversation

#### Interface Philosophy

**Snowflake Cortex: Text-to-SQL Console**
- Type natural language into SQL interface
- Get SQL table output
- No follow-up questions (stateless architecture)
- Technical errors exposed to business users
- No conversation, no context, no guidance

**Scoop: Conversational Analytics in Slack**
- Natural Slack conversation with @Scoop bot
- Multi-turn investigation with context retention
- Personal Decks for saved queries
- Business-friendly output (narratives + presentations)
- Collaborative threads (team can see and build on analysis)

#### Side-by-Side: Churn Investigation

**❌ Snowflake Cortex Experience**:

```
User (in Snowflake console): "Why are enterprise customers churning?"

Cortex Output:
ERROR: Actual statement count 3 did not match the desired statement count 1

User tries again: "Show enterprise customer churn rate"

Cortex Output:
+----------------+-------+--------+
| customer_id    | value | status |
+----------------+-------+--------+
| 12345          | 450   | churn  |
| 67890          | 320   | active |
| 13579          | 890   | churn  |
... (1,247 rows)
+----------------+-------+--------+

Questions you must answer yourself:
❓ Why did they churn?
❓ What's the pattern?
❓ Which accounts are at risk?
❓ What should I do?

Next steps:
- Export CSV
- Analyze in Excel
- Create charts
- Build PowerPoint
- Write recommendations
```

**✅ Scoop Experience**:

```
User (in Slack): "@Scoop why are enterprise customers churning?"

Scoop (30 seconds later):
"Enterprise Churn Investigation - October 2025

PRIMARY CAUSE IDENTIFIED (84% confidence):
Support Escalation Pattern
- Churned customers: Average 4.7 unresolved tickets in final 60 days
- Retained customers: Average 0.9 unresolved tickets
- Pattern: >3 unresolved tickets = 89% churn probability
- Affected: 73 current accounts at high risk

ACTIONABLE INSIGHT:
23 accounts have 5+ open tickets RIGHT NOW
Projected churn: $1.8M ARR if no intervention
Recommended action: Executive sponsor calls this week

SECONDARY FACTOR (76% confidence):
Feature Adoption Stagnation
- Churned: Used 1.8 features on average
- Retained: Used 6.2 features on average
- Pattern: <3 features = 76% churn risk

[High-Risk Account Dashboard]
- 23 accounts with 5+ tickets
- Sorted by ARR (highest risk first)
- Executive sponsor recommendations
- Last interaction dates

[Branded PowerPoint: "Enterprise Churn Prevention Strategy"]
- Root cause analysis
- High-risk account list
- Intervention playbook

[Personal Deck card created]

Would you like me to:
1. Draft executive sponsor outreach emails
2. Schedule weekly high-risk account reviews
3. Analyze which features drive retention"

User: "Yes, draft the emails"

Scoop:
"[Generates 23 personalized emails with account-specific context]
Ready to send via Salesforce. Review first?"
```

#### Conversation Capabilities Comparison

| Interaction Feature | Snowflake Cortex | Scoop | Business Value |
|---------------------|------------------|-------|----------------|
| **Context Retention** | No (stateless) | Yes (full conversation history) | Build insights progressively |
| **Follow-up Questions** | No (each query independent) | Yes (natural conversation flow) | Dig deeper without starting over |
| **Multi-Turn Investigation** | Not supported | 3-10 automated queries | Root cause discovery |
| **Hypothesis Testing** | Manual | Automatic (5-10 hypotheses) | Scientific analysis |
| **Action Recommendations** | None | Built-in with confidence scoring | Know what to do next |
| **Personal Workspace** | None (start over each time) | Personal Decks (save & refresh) | Self-service dashboards |
| **Collaboration** | Individual console sessions | Slack threads (team visibility) | Team learning |

### 1.3 Personal Decks: Self-Service Dashboards Without IT

#### The Dashboard Backlog Problem

**Industry Reality**:
- Business users need dashboards
- IT backlog: 4-6 weeks for new dashboard request
- Requirements get lost in translation
- By the time dashboard is ready, business needs have changed

**Snowflake Cortex "Solution"**:
- No personal workspace
- Every query starts from scratch
- Must re-type questions daily
- OR submit IT ticket for dashboard (6-week wait)

**Scoop Solution: Personal Decks**

```
Step 1: Ask question naturally
  "@Scoop what's my pipeline value by stage?"

Step 2: Save to Personal Deck (one click)
  "Save to Personal Deck" button

Step 3: Refresh anytime
  Morning routine: "@Scoop refresh my deck"
  Get updated dashboard in 5 seconds

Step 4: Share when ready (optional)
  Share specific cards or whole deck with team
```

#### Personal Decks Use Cases by Department

**Sales Rep - Pipeline Dashboard**:
```
Personal Deck Cards:
1. Total pipeline value by stage
2. Top 10 deals by close probability
3. Forecast vs quota this quarter
4. Deals at risk (stalled >14 days)
5. Average deal size trend

Refresh: Every morning at 8 AM (automated)
Access: Slack mobile app

```

#### Business Impact Quantification

| Metric | Traditional Dashboard (IT-built) | Snowflake Cortex | Scoop Personal Decks |
|--------|----------------------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Time to Create** | 4-6 weeks | N/A (not available) | 30 seconds |
| **Cost to Build** | $2K-$5K (IT time) | $0 | $0 |
| **Modification Time** | 1-2 weeks per change | N/A | 10 seconds (DIY) |
| **IT Tickets Required** | 1 to build + 3-5/year for changes | Ongoing for every query | Zero |
| **User Control** | None (IT owns dashboard) | None | 100% (user owns deck) |
| **Refresh Speed** | Manual or scheduled | Manual query re-run | 5 seconds on-demand |
| **Mobile Access** | Dashboard app required | No mobile access | Native Slack mobile |
| **Sharing** | Dashboard URL | Copy/paste results | One-click share |

**Annual IT Savings** (200 users):
- Traditional: 200 users × 3 dashboard requests/year × $3K each = $1.8M
- Personal Decks: $0 (users build their own)
- **SAVINGS: $1.8M + freed IT capacity for strategic projects**
