# 3waycompare AEO/SEO Optimization - Ready for Execution

## Status: âœ… READY TO EXECUTE

### What We've Accomplished
1. **Comprehensive Assessment**: Created 1,025-line AEO_SEO_ASSESSMENT.md identifying 5 fatal flaws
2. **Implementation Plan v2.0**: Enhanced with latest Webflow AEO insights
3. **AEO Maturity Path**: Clear progression from Level 2 (Answers) to Level 4 (Pillar)

### Key Insights from Webflow Research

#### 1. Content Clustering is Critical
- Need hub page + supporting content across buyer journey
- Current isolated comparisons miss topical authority opportunity
- Solution: Create comprehensive BI comparison hub

#### 2. Readability Drives AI Extraction
- Current Flesch score: ~60 (too complex)
- Target: 80-90+ for AI-friendly chunks
- Shorter sentences, active voice, clear structure

#### 3. Long-Tail + Conversational Queries Win
- Focus on "how to choose between X and Y for [industry]"
- Include intent modifiers: "best", "for", "vs"
- Target 4.4x-23x higher conversion rates

#### 4. Personalization Multiplies Impact
- Industry-specific sections (healthcare, finance, retail)
- Department perspectives (sales, marketing, ops)
- Company size considerations (SMB vs enterprise)

### Execution Priorities (Week 1)

#### Day 1: Fix TL;DR Generation (2 hours)
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/dev/competitive-intelligence/3waycompare

# 1. Update prompt template with 3-sentence structure
# Edit: src/main/resources/prompts/executive_summary.md

./gradlew run --args="thoughtspot domo"

# 3. Verify word count (target: 50-58)
grep -A 3 "TL;DR" output/thoughtspot-vs-domo-vs-scoop-ai.md | wc -w
```

#### Day 2: Implement Question Clusters (4 hours)
```bash
# 1. Create question database

# 2. Research real queries:

# - G2 Q&A sections

# 3. Integrate into FAQ generation
# Update: AIComparisonGenerator.java
```

#### Day 3: Add Extractable Summaries (3 hours)

# 1. Add summary blocks to templates
# Update all prompt files in src/main/resources/prompts/

# 2. Implement validation

# 3. Test extraction readiness
python3 scripts/validate_summaries.py output/*.md
```
