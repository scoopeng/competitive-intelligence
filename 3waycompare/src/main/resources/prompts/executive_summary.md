  Primary Weaknesses: {aWeaknesses}
  Key Evidence: {aEvidence}

- {competitorB}: BUA Score {bScore}/100 ({bCategory})  
  Primary Weaknesses: {bWeaknesses}
  Key Evidence: {bEvidence}

- Scoop: BUA Score 82/100 (A Strong)

OUTPUT CONTRACT â€“ READ CAREFULLY:

Return a JSON object with the following structure:
```json
{
  "markdown": {
    "tldrVerdict": "[EXACTLY 50-58 words comparing all three platforms with BUA scores]",
    "whatIsScoop": "[EXACTLY 50-58 words starting with 'Scoop is an AI data analyst you chat with...']",
    "chooseScoopIf": "[3-4 bullet points, each 15-25 words]",
    "considerAIf": "[2-3 bullet points for {competitorA}, each 15-25 words]",
    "considerBIf": "[2-3 bullet points for {competitorB}, each 15-25 words]",
    "bottomLine": "[100-150 words synthesis with evidence citations]"
  }
}
```

REQUIREMENTS:

1. **TL;DR Verdict**: 
   - Must include all three BUA scores
   - Position Scoop's investigation capability as key differentiator
   - Natural comparison flow (not just listing scores)

2. **What is Scoop**:
   - MUST start with "Scoop is an AI data analyst you chat with"
   - Include "not a dashboard" positioning
   - Mention Excel/Slack native integration

3. **Choose Scoop If**:
   - Focus on business user autonomy benefits
   - Include specific use cases (investigation, Excel users, non-technical teams)
   - Avoid technical jargon

4. **Consider Competitors If**:
   - Be fair and balanced
   - Acknowledge legitimate use cases
   - Focus on organizational fit (e.g., "existing {vendor} ecosystem")

5. **Bottom Line**:
   - Weave in evidence citations naturally [Evidence: source]
   - Emphasize investigation vs dashboard paradigm shift  
   - Include TCO advantage (eliminate 5 of 6 cost categories)
   - End with forward-looking statement about business empowerment

EXAMPLE OUTPUT STYLE:

"tldrVerdict": "Scoop (82/100 BUA) delivers true business autonomy through multi-pass investigation, while {competitorA} ({aScore}/100) and {competitorB} ({bScore}/100) remain dashboard-bound tools requiring IT support. Scoop's AI analyst approach means users investigate independently, finding root causes in minutes not days."

"whatIsScoop": "Scoop is an AI data analyst you chat with, not another dashboard tool. Ask questions in plain English, get answers with charts. Works natively in Excel and Slack where business users already work. No SQL, no training, no semantic layer maintenance required."

AVOID:
- Marketing hyperbole ("revolutionary", "game-changing")
- Unsubstantiated claims without evidence
- Technical details that business users don't care about
- Specific pricing (say "fraction of TCO" not dollar amounts)
