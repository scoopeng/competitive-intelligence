## How to Monitor Progress

### Option 1: Live Monitor (Recommended)
```bash
./monitor_progress.sh
```
This shows:
- Current generation status
- Files completed so far
- Progress percentage
- Latest files generated
- Resource usage

### Option 2: Check Log File
```bash
tail -f generation_master.log
```

### Option 3: Quick Status
```bash
# Count generated files
ls -1 output/*-vs-*-vs-scoop-ai.md | wc -l

# See latest activity
tail -20 generation_master.log | grep -E "SUCCESS|FAILED|Progress"

# Check if still running
ps -p 994139
```

## Output Location
All generated comparisons will be in:
```
output/[competitor1]-vs-[competitor2]-vs-scoop-ai.md
```

## Logs
- Main log: `generation_master.log`
- Individual logs: `logs/[competitor1]-vs-[competitor2].log`
- Failures: `logs/failures.txt`

## Final Report
When complete, a comprehensive report will be generated:
- `generation_report.md` - Summary with validation results

## What Each Comparison Includes
‚úÖ TL;DR Executive Summary (50-52 words)
‚úÖ BUA Framework Analysis with scores
‚úÖ 5 Capability Deep Dives
‚úÖ 14 FAQ Questions with answers

## If You Need to Stop

# Kill the generation process
kill 994139

# Or more forcefully
kill -9 994139
```

## Expected Results
- **Success Rate**: ~95% (some competitors may fail)
- **Total Files**: ~52-55 comparisons
- **Total Size**: ~10-15MB of content
- **AEO Grade**: B+ average

## Notes
