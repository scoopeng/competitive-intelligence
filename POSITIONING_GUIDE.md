## 1. The Core Narrative Shift

| **Old Narrative (Legacy)** | **New Narrative (Domain Intelligence)** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"We are an AI Analyst"** | **"We are a Domain Intelligence Platform"** |
| **Hero**: Speed & Convenience | **Hero**: Autonomous Investigation & Context |
| **Enemy**: "Portal Prison" (Login Fatigue) | **Enemy**: "Generic AI" (Hallucinations) & "Passive BI" (Manual Work) |
| **Hook**: "30 seconds in Slack" | **Hook**: "Wake up to completed investigations" |
| **Secret**: Spreadsheet Engine | **Secret**: Investigation Coordinator & Hierarchical JSON |

## 2. Primary Value Proposition
**"Encode your best executive's expertise once, and scale it infinitely across your organization."**

*   **The Problem**: Your COO knows exactly how to spot a failing store, but they can't review 1,000 locations every morning.
*   **The Solution**: We capture their mental model (patterns, thresholds, logic) in a 4-hour "Encoding Session" and load it into Scoop.
*   **The Result**: Scoop acts as a deterministic, autonomous clone of your best operator, investigating every single location, every single day.

## 3. Attack Vectors by Competitor Category

### A. Against "Generic AI" (Snowflake Cortex, Copilots, ChatGPT)
*   **The Attack**: "They have a PhD in English, but they know nothing about your business."
*   **The Gap**: Generic models rely on probability. They hallucinate. They guess. They don't know that "High Churn" in *your* business means >5% only for *new* customers.
*   **Our Win**: **Bounded Context**. We don't guess. We use your defined JSON schema.
*   **Key Line**: "Do you want a chatbot that guesses, or an investigation engine that follows your specific business rules?"

### B. Against "Passive BI" (PowerBI, Tableau, Looker)
*   **The Attack**: "Dashboards show you WHAT happened. You still have to do the work to find out WHY."
*   **The Gap**: A dashboard is a "monitored state." It waits for you to look at it. It waits for you to filter. It waits for you to find the insight.
*   **Our Win**: **Autonomy**. Scoop wakes you up with the answer. "Store 523 is down because of inventory paralysis in Category X."
*   **Key Line**: "Stop investigating dashboards. Let Domain Intelligence investigate for you."

### C. Against "Natural Language Query" (ThoughtSpot, Zenlytic)
*   **The Attack**: "Answering a question is not the same as conducting an investigation."
*   **The Gap**: These tools answer "What was revenue?" (Tier 1). They cannot do "Why did revenue drop, what factors drove it, and is it a pattern?" (Tier 2 & 3).
*   **Our Win**: **The Investigation Coordinator**. We don't just run SQL. We spawn child investigations, drill down into segments, and synthesize findings.
*   **Key Line**: "Text-to-SQL is a commodity. Learned Business Intelligence is an asset."

## 4. The "Kill Shot": TCO is now the Closer, not the Opener
*   **Previously**: We led with "We save you money."
*   **Now**: We lead with "We give you superpowers (Encoded Expertise)."
*   **Then**: We close with "...and by the way, because we don't use 'per-seat' pricing and we eliminate the need for 5 other tools, your TCO drops by 90%."

## 5. Objection Handling

*   **"We already have Copilot."** -> "Great for writing emails. But would you trust it to run your operations? Scoop is deterministic. It follows your rules, not a black box's probability."
*   **"We have 500 dashboards."** -> "And how many do you actually look at? Scoop watches all of them for you and only tells you when something matters, explaining *why*."
*   **"Is this just another chatbot?"** -> "No. A chatbot waits for you to type. Scoop runs 24/7 on a schedule, proactively investigating your business based on the rules we configure together."
