# Updated Research Findings - January 2025

## Critical New Discoveries from Fresh Web Research

### 1. Power BI / Excel COPILOT Function (NEW FINDING)

**Microsoft now has COPILOT function in Excel** (2025):
- =COPILOT("prompt", range) directly in cells
- Separate from Power BI Copilot
- Built into Excel calculation engine
- Auto-updates when data changes

**Critical Distinction**:
- This is Excel Copilot, NOT Power BI Copilot integration
- Two separate products with separate licenses
- Power BI Copilot still doesn't provide native Excel formulas
- Excel COPILOT requires Microsoft 365 Copilot license

**Implications for Scoop**:
- Microsoft is fragmenting their AI across products
- =SCOOP() still superior (investigation vs generation)
- Their approach creates license confusion
- We investigate; they generate text

### 2. Snowflake Cortex Contribution Explorer (SIGNIFICANT UPDATE)

**New Investigation Capabilities Found**:
- TOP_INSIGHTS() function for root cause
- Contribution Explorer for metric analysis
- Automatically finds important dimensions
- Segments data and detects influences

**But Still Limited**:
- SQL-based, not true multi-pass reasoning
- Still requires all data in Snowflake
- No hypothesis testing framework
- Single-metric focus

**Updated Assessment**: 
- Better than initially assessed but still Category D
- Has some investigation features but architecturally limited
- 6-12 month migration still required

### 3. Domo Agentic AI (2024-2025 Evolution)

**New Developments**:
- Agent Catalyst development suite
- Agentic workflows for automation
- Code Engine, DDX Bricks, Workflows
- App Studio automation

**Reality Check**:
- Still dashboard-first architecture
- No schema evolution capabilities found
- Complex setup remains
- "Business users find it complicated"

**Confirmation**: Category C positioning validated

### 4. DataGPT Deep Dive (NEW INSIGHTS)

**Strengths Discovered**:
- 85% business user adoption claimed
- Lightning Cache: 100x speed improvement
- Zero hallucinations claimed
- 2,178% quarterly ROI claimed
- Transparent algorithm (not black box)

**Critical Limitations**:
- One-time schema setup required (days)
- Schema rarely adjustable after setup
- Complex questions take minutes
- No real schema evolution
- Price not transparent

**Key Quote**: "There's nothing else like DataGPT" - but investigation depth unclear

## Updated Moat Analysis Based on New Research

### Investigation Engine
**Previous Understanding**: Scoop unique
**Updated Finding**: 
- Snowflake has Contribution Explorer (limited)
- DataGPT claims root cause analysis
- BUT: None have true multi-pass hypothesis testing
**Conclusion**: Moat remains strong

### Schema Evolution
**Previous Understanding**: Complete failure across competitors
**New Research Confirms**: 
- No competitor handles automatic schema evolution
- DataGPT: Schema fixed after setup
- Domo: No evidence of capability
- Snowflake: Still rigid
**Conclusion**: Moat completely validated

### Excel Integration
**Previous Understanding**: Scoop unique with =SCOOP()
**New Finding**: 
- Microsoft has =COPILOT() in Excel
- BUT: It's text generation, not investigation
- Separate from Power BI, requires different license
**Conclusion**: Different approaches, our moat intact

### ML Explainability
**New Findings**:
- DataGPT claims "transparent algorithm"
- But no decision trees mentioned
- Snowflake uses ML but black box
**Conclusion**: J48 explainability remains unique

## Competitive Positioning Updates

### DataGPT - Requires Deeper Analysis
**Positive Surprises**:
- 85% adoption rate (if true)
- Speed claims impressive
- Transparency emphasis

**Red Flags**:
- Schema rigidity after setup
- Pricing opacity
- "Minutes for complex questions"
- No multi-source mentioned

**Preliminary Score**: ~20/40 (Category C)

### Snowflake Cortex - Slightly Better But Still D
**Contribution Explorer** adds some investigation capability
**But fundamentally limited** by:
- Single-source prison
- SQL-only logic
- Migration requirement

**Updated Score**: 12/40 (was 11/40)

### Power BI - More Fragmented
**Excel COPILOT** adds confusion:
- Users need multiple licenses
- Different AI in different products
- Not integrated

**Score Unchanged**: 13/40

## Key Takeaways from Fresh Research

1. **Investigation Capabilities Emerging** - But none match multi-pass reasoning
2. **Schema Evolution Completely Absent** - Validated across all competitors
3. **Microsoft Fragmenting AI** - Creating license/product confusion
4. **DataGPT Interesting But Limited** - Good adoption but rigid schema
5. **Speed Claims Proliferating** - Everyone claims "seconds" now

## Sales Implications

### New Discovery Questions
1. "Do you have both Power BI Copilot AND Excel Copilot licenses?"
2. "How often do you need to change your DataGPT schema?"
3. "Can Snowflake's Contribution Explorer test multiple hypotheses?"
4. "How long do complex questions take in DataGPT?"

### Updated Objection Handlers

**"Excel has COPILOT function now"**
"Yes, for text generation. Can it investigate why sales dropped? Can it test hypotheses? That's the difference between generating text and discovering insights."

**"Snowflake has Contribution Explorer"**
"True, it can analyze metric contributions. But can it work with data outside Snowflake? Can it test competing hypotheses? That's single-metric analysis, not investigation."

**"DataGPT has 85% adoption"**
"Among how many users? And once their schema is set, how do they handle changes? We see 95% adoption because users can evolve their data structure freely."

## Research Gaps Still Needing Investigation

1. DataGPT actual customer base size
2. Domo's Agent Catalyst real capabilities
3. Zenlytic's current state
4. Tellius updates
5. Sisense, Qlik recent changes
