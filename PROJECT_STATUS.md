# Competitive Intelligence Project Status

**Last Updated**: January 28, 2025  
**Session**: Initial research phase complete  
**Next Step**: Continue with remaining competitors

## Quick Status Summary

### ✅ What's Complete
- **Framework**: Research methodology, folder structure, documentation standards
- **8 Competitors Analyzed**: Detailed research with source documentation
- **3 Tiers Identified**: Clear patterns emerged
- **Key Finding**: Scoop is uniquely positioned with BOTH real AI AND accessibility

### 📊 Research Progress
```
Total Competitors Analyzed: 8/15+
- Tier 1 (AI Pretenders): 4 complete
- Tier 2 (Accessible AI): 1 found (DataGPT)
- Tier 3 (Real AI/Complex): 3 complete

Completion Level: All at 85% (need screenshots)
Total Hours Invested: 15+
Source Documents Created: 100+
```

### 🎯 Key Discoveries

1. **Tier Patterns Confirmed**:
   - 50% are AI pretenders (no real ML)
   - 37.5% have real AI but too complex
   - 12.5% have some accessibility (DataGPT only)

2. **DataGPT Analysis** (Important):
   - Initially seemed like major threat
   - Actually just fast query engine
   - Missing 90% of Scoop features
   - Positioning: "They're a feature, we're a platform"

3. **Scoop's Unique Position**:
   - ONLY solution with real AI + accessibility + complete features
   - 70-97% lower cost than alternatives
   - True self-service (not IT dependent)

### 🚀 Next Session Priorities

1. **Complete Screenshots** for all existing competitors
2. **Research Missing Competitors**:
   - Sisense, Domo, MicroStrategy (likely Tier 1)
   - Databricks, Alteryx, Palantir (confirmed Tier 3)
3. **Create Deliverables**:
   - Executive landscape table
   - Sales battle cards
   - Feature comparison matrix

### 💡 Important Context

**Why This Matters**: Building evidence-based library proving Scoop is the ONLY solution with:
- Real ML/AI capabilities (investigation engine, predictive analytics)
- True business user accessibility (Slack, no IT)
- Complete feature set (multi-dataset, PowerPoint, data prep, etc.)
- Affordable pricing ($299/month)

**Time Estimate**: 10-15 more hours to complete all competitors
