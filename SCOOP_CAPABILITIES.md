## 1. Spreadsheet Calculation Engine (UNIQUE TO SCOOP)

### What We Have Built
**Complete in-memory spreadsheet calculation engine** with 150+ Excel functions. This isn't integration—Scoop streams data through a spreadsheet to calculate transformed results, giving you access to the full range of spreadsheet functions for data preparation and analysis.

### The Technical Reality
- **In-Memory Spreadsheet Engine**: Full Excel-compatible formula execution
- **ScoopExpression Grammar**: 150+ Excel functions implemented
- **Dual-Purpose Engine**: Used both for runtime query results AND data preparation
- **Data Transformation Power**: Combine datasets, create formulas, calculate derived metrics—all using spreadsheet functions
- **Google Sheets Plugin**: Pull and refresh Scoop data into Google Sheets with utility functions

### How It Works
1. **Runtime Calculations**: Query results are processed through the spreadsheet engine, applying formulas and transformations
2. **Data Preparation**: Prepare and transform data using familiar spreadsheet formulas (VLOOKUP, SUMIFS, nested IFs, etc.)
3. **Dataset Combination**: Use spreadsheet logic to merge, join, and relate multiple data sources
4. **Google Sheets Integration**: Plugin provides utility functions to pull/refresh Scoop data into spreadsheets

### Function Categories Implemented

#### Mathematical Functions (26)
`SUM, SUMIF, SUMIFS, SUMPRODUCT, AVERAGE, AVERAGEIF, AVERAGEIFS, COUNT, COUNTA, COUNTIF, COUNTIFS, MAX, MIN, STDEV, MEDIAN, LOG, EXP, ABS, SQRT, ROUND, CEILING, FLOOR, MOD, POWER, RANDBETWEEN, SUBTOTAL`

#### Logical Functions (10)  
`IF, IFS, IFERROR, IFNA, AND, OR, XOR, NOT, TRUE, FALSE`

#### Lookup & Reference (7)
`VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, INDEX, MATCH, XMATCH, XLOOKUP, CHOOSE`

#### Text Functions (19)
`MID, FIND, LEFT, RIGHT, LEN, LOWER, UPPER, PROPER, REPLACE, SEARCH, TRIM, SUBSTITUTE, TEXT, VALUE, TEXTAFTER, TEXTBEFORE, TEXTJOIN, CONCATENATE, REGEXREPLACE`

#### Date & Time Functions (18)

### Business Impact
- **Zero Retraining**: Users leverage decades of Excel knowledge for data preparation
- **Sophisticated Data Prep**: Combine datasets, create complex transformations—more powerful and flexible than SQL
- **Accessible to Business Users**: Any Excel user can perform data engineering tasks without SQL knowledge
- **Runtime Transformation**: Query results processed through spreadsheet engine with formulas
- **Google Sheets Integration**: Plugin utility functions let you pull/refresh Scoop data into spreadsheets

### Competitive Reality
**NO COMPETITOR HAS THIS.** Others offer:
- Export to Excel (static snapshots)
- "Excel-like" interfaces (not actual spreadsheet calculation)
- SQL-based data prep (requires data engineers)
- Template downloads (no live transformation engine)

## 2. AI Data Scientist Engine

### The Three-Layer Revolution
**Users ask "Why?" and get PhD-level ML analysis explained in business language.** Scoop is a complete AI data scientist: automatically prepares data, runs real ML models (J48, JRip, EM Clustering), then explains the results like a consultant would.

### The Three-Layer Architecture (Unique to Scoop)

#### Layer 1: Automatic Data Preparation
- **Data cleaning**: Handles missing values, outliers, inconsistencies
- **Feature engineering**: Creates derived metrics, bins continuous variables
- **Normalization**: Scales data appropriately for ML algorithms
- **Feature selection**: Removes correlated variables automatically
- **Result**: Production-quality data science prep with zero user input

#### Layer 2: Explainable ML Model Execution
- **J48 Decision Trees**: Multi-level trees (can be 12+ levels, 800+ nodes)
- **JRip Rule Mining**: Association rules and pattern discovery
- **EM Clustering**: Statistical segmentation with confidence scores
- **Result**: Explainable models (not black boxes) but too verbose for business users

#### Layer 3: AI Explanation Engine
- **Analyzes model output**: Parses complex trees, rules, clusters
- **Translates to business language**: Converts statistical output to actionable insights
- **Provides recommendations**: Not just patterns, but what to do about them
- **Result**: Business users get consultant-quality analysis without knowing ML ran

### What Happens Automatically

#### Investigation Workflow
1. **User asks**: "Why did sales drop?"
2. **Scoop prepares data**: Automatic cleaning, binning, feature engineering
3. **ML models run**: J48 trees (847 nodes), JRip rules, EM clustering execute
4. **AI explains results**: "High-risk customers have >3 support tickets + inactive 30+ days"

**Time**: 10-60 seconds
**ML expertise required**: ZERO
**User awareness of ML**: NO
**Data science work done**: PhD-level  

### ML Models We Run Automatically

#### ML_RELATIONSHIP (J48 Decision Trees)
- **Purpose**: Find what drives outcomes through explainable decision tree analysis
- **What runs**: Multi-level J48 tree (can be 12+ levels deep, 800+ nodes)
- **What user sees**: AI-explained business rules with confidence scores
- **Example output**: "High-risk churn: >3 support tickets + inactive 30+ days + tenure <6 months (89% accuracy)"

#### ML_CLUSTER (EM Clustering)
- **Purpose**: Discover natural customer/product segments automatically
- **What runs**: EM clustering with BIC/AIC optimization (statistical output with μ, σ scores)
- **What user sees**: Named segments with business characteristics and strategy recommendations
- **Example output**: "Power Users (18%, 42% of revenue): Daily usage, 3+ integrations, 95% retention. Strategy: Protect and upsell."

#### ML_GROUP (Comparative Analysis)
- **Purpose**: Compare populations to find statistically significant differences
- **What runs**: Multi-variate statistical comparison across populations
- **What user sees**: Key differences explained with business impact
- **Example output**: "High-value customers use mobile 67% vs 23% for low-value. Mobile adoption = 3x value indicator."

#### ML_PERIOD (Temporal ML)
- **Purpose**: Identify time-based patterns and leading indicators
- **What runs**: Temporal pattern analysis with correlation and causality detection
- **What user sees**: Business-relevant timing patterns with actionable insights
- **Example output**: "Sales spikes precede churn by 6 weeks in B2B. Set 6-week check-in triggers."

### Business Impact
- **True AI Data Scientist**: Automatic data prep + real ML + AI explanation = complete workflow
- **PhD-Level Analysis**: J48 trees with 800+ nodes, EM clustering, JRip rules - real data science
- **Business Language**: Complex model output translated to actionable insights
- **No Data Scientist Needed**: Full data science workflow automated
- **Discovery Power**: Find patterns humans miss, explained so humans understand

### Competitive Reality
Others offer one of three inadequate approaches:
1. **No ML**: Just SQL queries or basic statistics marketed as "AI"
2. **Black Box ML**: Predictions without explanations (unusable for business decisions)
3. **Raw Model Output**: Explainable models but dump technical output on users (requires PhD to interpret)

**Scoop uniquely offers**: Real ML + Automatic data prep + AI explanation layer = Business users get data scientist-quality work

## 3. Multi-Pass Investigation Engine

### How Scoop Thinks
While competitors answer "what happened," Scoop investigates "why it happened" through multi-pass reasoning with full context retention.

### Investigation Architecture

#### Multi-Pass Reasoning
- **3-10 SQL queries** per investigation
- **Context preservation** across queries
- **Hypothesis testing** - tests multiple theories
- **Evidence building** - each query informs next

#### Investigation Types

**Root Cause Analysis**:
```
Query 1: "What changed in Q4?"
Query 2: "Which segments drove the change?"
Query 3: "What was different about those segments?"
Query 4: "When exactly did the change start?"
Query 5: "What external factors correlate?"
```

**Comparative Investigation**:
```
Query 1: "Compare high vs low performers"
Query 2: "What's unique about top quartile?"
Query 3: "Test hypothesis: Is it timing-based?"
Query 4: "Validate with similar segments"
```

### Business Impact
- **Deep Insights**: Find root causes, not just symptoms  
- **Conversation Intelligence**: Remembers context across questions
- **Human-like Reasoning**: Tests theories like analysts do
- **Compound Discovery**: Each query builds on previous findings

### Competitive Reality
Others provide:
- Single query responses
- No context retention
- Dashboard navigation (user does investigation)
- **None provide multi-pass reasoning with AI investigation**
