## 2. Automatic ML Discovery Engine

### The Revolution We've Built
**Users ask "Why?" and get PhD-level ML analysis without knowing ML exists.** Scoop runs actual machine learning models (J48, JRip, EM Clustering) automatically to discover patterns no human would find.

### What Happens Automatically

#### Investigation Workflow
1. **User asks**: "Why did sales drop?"
2. **Scoop launches**: 3-10 automated probes
3. **ML models run**: J48, JRip, EM clustering execute
4. **Results delivered**: "IF tenure < 6 months AND tickets > 3 THEN churn = 87%"

**Time**: 10-60 seconds  
**ML expertise required**: ZERO  
**User awareness of ML**: NO  

### ML Models We Run Automatically

#### ML_RELATIONSHIP (J48 Decision Trees)
- **Purpose**: Find what drives outcomes
- **Output**: Human-readable rules
- **Example**: "IF customer_age > 45 AND purchase_history > $5000 THEN loyalty = HIGH (confidence: 92%)"

#### ML_CLUSTER (EM Clustering) 
- **Purpose**: Discover natural segments
- **Output**: Customer/product groups
- **Example**: "Found 4 distinct buying patterns: Power Users (23%), Bargain Hunters (31%), Loyalists (28%), Experimenters (18%)"

#### ML_GROUP (Comparative Analysis)
- **Purpose**: Compare populations statistically
- **Output**: Significant differences with confidence
- **Example**: "High-value customers: 67% mobile app usage vs 23% low-value (p<0.001)"

#### ML_PERIOD (Temporal ML)
- **Purpose**: Time-based pattern analysis
- **Output**: Seasonal trends and causality
- **Example**: "Sales spike precedes churn by 6 weeks in B2B segment (correlation: 0.78)"

### Business Impact
- **Discovery of Unknown Unknowns**: Find patterns humans miss
- **Actionable Insights**: Get specific rules, not black boxes
- **No Data Scientist Needed**: ML expertise built into questions
- **Explainable Results**: Every model output interpretable

### Competitive Reality
Others offer:
- Statistics marketed as "AI" (ARIMA from 1970s)
- Black box predictions (no explanations)
- Manual ML (requires data scientists)
- **None offer automatic explanatory ML from natural language**

## 3. Multi-Pass Investigation Engine

### How Scoop Thinks
While competitors answer "what happened," Scoop investigates "why it happened" through multi-pass reasoning with full context retention.

### Investigation Architecture

#### Multi-Pass Reasoning
- **3-10 SQL queries** per investigation
- **Context preservation** across queries
- **Hypothesis testing** - tests multiple theories
- **Evidence building** - each query informs next

#### Investigation Types

**Root Cause Analysis**:
```
Query 1: "What changed in Q4?"
Query 2: "Which segments drove the change?"
Query 3: "What was different about those segments?"
Query 4: "When exactly did the change start?"
Query 5: "What external factors correlate?"
```

**Comparative Investigation**:
```
Query 1: "Compare high vs low performers"
Query 2: "What's unique about top quartile?"
Query 3: "Test hypothesis: Is it timing-based?"
Query 4: "Validate with similar segments"
```

### Business Impact
- **Deep Insights**: Find root causes, not just symptoms  
- **Conversation Intelligence**: Remembers context across questions
- **Human-like Reasoning**: Tests theories like analysts do
- **Compound Discovery**: Each query builds on previous findings

### Competitive Reality
Others provide:
- Single query responses
- No context retention
- Dashboard navigation (user does investigation)
- **None provide multi-pass reasoning with AI investigation**
