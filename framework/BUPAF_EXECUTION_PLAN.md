## 📚 Existing Research Foundation

### CRITICAL: Leverage Existing Work First
**The competitive-intelligence repository already contains extensive research:**
- 106+ markdown files with detailed analysis
- 9,000+ words per major competitor
- Extensive source documentation and evidence
- Customer quotes and testimonials
- Technical architecture analysis

### Deep Analysis Approach for Each Competitor
1. **FIRST**: Read all existing files in competitor's folder
   - Check `/tier1-ai-pretenders/[competitor]/*`
   - Check `/tier2-accessible-ai/[competitor]/*`
   - Check `/tier3-real-ai/[competitor]/*`
   - Review all sources/ subfolders
   
2. **SECOND**: Test for ALL Scoop Moats
   - Investigation capability (multi-pass reasoning?)
   - Schema evolution (what breaks on changes?)
   - ML explainability (black box or transparent?)
   - Native integration (export only or true integration?)
   - Domain intelligence (generic or contextual?)
   - [New moats discovered during analysis]
   
3. **THIRD**: Score using BUPAF framework v2.0
   - Weight investigation heavily in Analytical Depth
   - Consider all moats in scoring
   - Document evidence for every point
   
4. **FOURTH**: Identify hidden limitations
   - What users complain about
   - Architectural constraints
   - Things they promise but don't deliver
   
5. **FIFTH**: Conduct deep web research
   - Test all capability areas
   - Find technical documentation
   - Uncover user frustrations
   
6. **SIXTH**: Create comprehensive documentation
   - BUPAF analysis with all moats tested
   - Battle card with multiple positioning angles
   - Evidence library with quotes and sources

## 🤖 Automation Instructions for Claude

### Session Initialization
```python
# At start of each session:
1. Read BUPAF_EXECUTION_PLAN.md (this file)
2. Check PROGRESS_LOG.md for last completed task
3. Load BUSINESS_USER_POWER_FRAMEWORK.md for scoring
4. Identify next unchecked item in checklist

   - Load /tier*/[competitor]/README.md
   - Load /tier*/[competitor]/sources/*.md
   - Extract key findings and evidence
   - Note what's already documented
   
2. TEST ALL MOATS:
   - Investigation: Can they do multi-pass reasoning?
   - Schema: What happens when data structure changes?
   - ML: Is it explainable or black box?
   - Integration: Native or just export/import?
   - Intelligence: Generic or domain-aware?
   - [Check for new moats we haven't seen]
   
3. DEEP WEB RESEARCH:
   - Run all 25+ search queries
   - Read technical documentation
   - Find user complaints and workarounds
   - Discover architectural limitations
   - Look for promised but undelivered features
   
4. ANALYZE WITH BUPAF v2.0:
   - Score on 4 dimensions with full evidence
   - Weight investigation and explainability heavily
   - Consider all moats in scoring
   - Document why each point given/not given
   
5. CREATE COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTATION:
   - Create folder: /category-[x]-[name]/[competitor]/
   - Create bupaf-analysis.md with all moats analyzed
   - Create battle-card with multiple angles
   - Build evidence library with quotes
   - Preserve valuable content from old README
   
6. UPDATE TRACKING:
   - Update QUICK_COMPARISON_MATRIX.md
