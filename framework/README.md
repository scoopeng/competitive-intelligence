# Framework Directory

This directory contains the Business User Autonomy Framework - a measurement system for evaluating analytics platforms based on non-technical business user independence.

---

## Active Framework

**[BUSINESS_USER_EMPOWERMENT_FRAMEWORK.md](BUSINESS_USER_EMPOWERMENT_FRAMEWORK.md)** (Version 2.0 - September 2025)

The Business User Autonomy Framework measures analytics platforms across 5 dimensions:
1. **Autonomy** - Self-service setup & question independence (no IT)
2. **Flow** - Work in existing tools (no portal)
3. **Understanding** - Deep insights explained (no analyst)
4. **Presentation** - Professional branded output (no designer)
5. **Data** - All data operations (no data engineer)

**Total Score**: 59 points across 16 components (enhanced September 2025)

### Why This Framework?

This framework proposes a **fifth category** beyond Gartner's four primary analytics use cases:

**Gartner's Four Categories:**
1. Centralized BI Provisioning
2. Decentralized Analytics
3. Governed Data Discovery
4. OEM/Embedded BI

**The Missing Fifth: Business User Autonomy**
- Non-technical business users operating completely independently
- Zero IT setup, zero analyst involvement, zero data engineering
- Natural language only, no SQL/DAX/Python
- Minutes to productivity, not weeks/months

### What This Framework Does NOT Measure

- Enterprise governance frameworks (centralized control)
- Enterprise IT features (massive scale, complex auth)
- Traditional BI strengths (governed semantic models, operational reporting)

**Why**: These capabilities require IT departments and centralized control - the opposite of business user autonomy.

### Use This Framework When

**Evaluating for Business User Autonomy:**
- Can non-technical users (marketing manager, sales VP) operate independently?
- Is speed to insight more important than governance?
- Do business users need ad-hoc investigation vs standardized reports?

**Don't Use This Framework When:**
- Evaluating enterprise governance capabilities
- Measuring traditional BI platform features
- Prioritizing centralized control over independence

## Framework Usage

### For Competitive Analysis

1. **Score each competitor** using detailed rubrics in BUSINESS_USER_EMPOWERMENT_FRAMEWORK.md
2. **Document evidence** for each sub-component score
3. **Update battle cards** with framework scores
4. **Generate BUA comparison pages** using template

### For Sales & Marketing

- **Lead with category positioning**: "We compete in Business User Autonomy, not traditional BI"
- **Use framework scores**: "Power BI scores 15/50 because it's designed for IT control (Category C), we score 42/50 because we're designed for business user independence (Category A)"
- **Acknowledge trade-offs**: "They optimize for governance, we optimize for autonomy - different categories, different needs"
