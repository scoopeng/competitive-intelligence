# Category A: Business User Empowerment Platforms (36-40 points)

**Definition**: Platforms that enable complete business user independence with no technical barriers.

## Current Members
- **Scoop** (36/40) - Only platform achieving true business user empowerment

## Qualification Criteria
To achieve Category A status, platforms must score 36+ points across:
- **Independence** (9-10/10): Business users completely self-sufficient
- **Analytical Depth** (9-10/10): Investigation, ML, and optimization
- **Workflow Integration** (9-10/10): Native Excel, automatic schema evolution
- **Business Communication** (9-10/10): Natural language with clear narratives

## Why Only Scoop Qualifies

### Universal Competitor Failures
1. **No schema evolution** - Every competitor requires IT for data changes
2. **No investigation engine** - All limited to single queries
3. **No Excel integration** - Export-only capabilities
4. **Dashboard dependency** - Must build views before analyzing
5. **Technical barriers** - Configuration, modeling, or coding required

### Scoop's Unique Capabilities
- **Investigation Engine**: Multi-pass reasoning testing hypotheses
- **Schema Evolution**: Automatic handling of structure changes
- **Excel Native**: =SCOOP() functions in spreadsheets
- **30-Second Setup**: No implementation required
- **True Self-Service**: Business users need zero IT support

## Market Implications
The fact that only one platform achieves Category A status reveals:
- Massive market gap in true business user empowerment
- Technical complexity remains the norm
- "Self-service" claims are largely marketing
- Opportunity for dramatic simplification
