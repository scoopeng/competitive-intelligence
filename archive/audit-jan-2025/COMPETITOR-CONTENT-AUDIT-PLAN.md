# Competitor Content Comprehensive Audit Plan
## January 2025 - Full Repository Review

---

## PHASE 1: DISCOVERY & INVENTORY

### 1.1 Archive Content Audit
```bash
# Count all archived files
find archive -type f -name "*.md" | wc -l

# List unique competitor mentions in archive
grep -r -h -o -i "tableau\|power-bi\|domo\|thoughtspot\|sisense\|qlik\|tellius\|zenlytic\|datagpt\|datachat" archive/ | sort -u

# Find large archived files (potential deep analysis)
find archive -type f -name "*.md" -exec wc -l {} + | sort -rn | head -20
```

### 1.2 Current Structure Inventory
```bash
# For each competitor, document:
for dir in competitors/*/; do
    echo "=== $(basename $dir) ==="
    echo "File count: $(ls $dir | wc -l)"
    echo "Total lines: $(cat $dir/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"
    echo "Files:"
    ls -la $dir
    echo ""
done > current_inventory.txt
```

### 1.3 Git History Check
```bash
# Check for deleted competitor files
git log --diff-filter=D --summary | grep -E "delete mode.*competitors"

# Check for moved/renamed files
git log --follow --name-status competitors/
```

## PHASE 2: CONTENT MAPPING

### 2.1 Expected Structure Per Competitor
Each competitor folder SHOULD contain:
- `README.md` - Navigation and quick summary
- `BATTLE_CARD.md` - Sales quick reference
- `DEEP_ANALYSIS.md` - Technical deep dive
- `EVIDENCE.md` - Links, sources, proof points
- `PRICING.md` - Cost analysis and comparisons
- `USER_STORIES.md` - Customer complaints/feedback
- Test scripts (if applicable)

## PHASE 3: COMPETITOR-BY-COMPETITOR DEEP REVIEW

### Review Process for Each Competitor:

#### Step 1: Archive Recovery
```bash
# Search archive for competitor-specific content
competitor="tableau"  # Change for each
grep -r -l -i "$competitor" archive/ | while read file; do
    echo "=== $file ==="
    head -20 "$file"
done
```

#### Step 2: Content Consolidation
1. Read ALL current files in competitor folder
2. Check for duplicated information
3. Check for missing critical evidence
4. Review BUPAF scoring justification

#### Step 3: Organization
1. Create README.md with navigation
2. Ensure consistent file naming
3. Move content to appropriate files
4. Add cross-references between files

#### Step 4: Enhancement Check
- Is the killer differentiator clear?
- Are proof points verifiable?
- Is pricing evidence documented?
- Are customer pain points captured?

#### Step 5: Quality Verification
- [ ] All claims have sources
- [ ] Battle card is concise (1-2 pages)
- [ ] Deep analysis covers technical gaps
- [ ] Evidence includes URLs
- [ ] Pricing is current and sourced

## PHASE 4: ARCHIVE CONTENT RESTORATION

### Priority Restorations:
1. **Tableau Pulse** - 127-line analysis in archive/process-files/old-battle-cards/
2. **Power BI Copilot** - Deep analysis in archive
3. **Marketing Analysis** - 3 files in archive/analysis/ folder
4. **Framework Documents** - Check archive/process-files/ for methodology

### Restoration Process:
```bash
# For each high-value archived file:
1. Review content for relevance
2. Check if duplicates current content
3. If unique and valuable, restore to appropriate competitor folder
4. Update README.md to reference restored content
```

---

## PHASE 5: FINAL STRUCTURE VALIDATION

### Repository Health Checks:
1. **Completeness**: Each competitor has minimum required files
2. **Consistency**: Same structure across all competitors
3. **Accessibility**: README.md guides in each folder
4. **Evidence**: All claims backed by sources
5. **Currency**: Recent updates noted

### Final Structure Goal:
```
competitors/
├── [competitor-name]/
│   ├── README.md           # Navigation & summary
│   ├── BATTLE_CARD.md      # 1-2 page sales tool
│   ├── DEEP_ANALYSIS.md    # Technical investigation
│   ├── EVIDENCE.md         # Proof URLs & sources
│   ├── PRICING.md          # Cost analysis
│   ├── USER_STORIES.md     # Customer feedback
│   └── tests/              # If applicable
│       └── test_*.py
```
