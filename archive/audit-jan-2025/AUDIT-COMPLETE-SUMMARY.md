## KEY DIFFERENTIATORS DOCUMENTED

Each competitor README now clearly identifies:

1. **Snowflake Cortex**: 4+ hour setup, not available on trials
2. **Tableau Pulse**: Schema changes break everything
3. **Power BI Copilot**: "Nondeterministic" (Microsoft's admission)
4. **Domo**: Portal prison - $134K/year
5. **ThoughtSpot**: 33.3% accuracy benchmark
6. **Sisense**: 400% renewal price increases
7. **Qlik**: Zero adoption after 5+ years
8. **Tellius**: Requires data scientists
9. **Zenlytic**: YAML configuration nightmare
10. **DataGPT**: Rigid schema, single-source only
11. **DataChat**: No market traction (possible vaporware)
