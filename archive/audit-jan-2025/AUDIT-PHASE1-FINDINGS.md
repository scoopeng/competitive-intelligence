# Phase 1 & 2 Audit Findings
## Discovery & Archive Recovery Results

## PHASE 1 DISCOVERY RESULTS

### Archive Summary
- **Total archived files**: 23 MD files
- **Large analysis files**: 7 files with 100+ lines
- **Old battle cards found**: 2 (Tableau, Power BI) - ALREADY RESTORED

### Current State Summary
| Competitor | Files | Total Lines | Status |
|------------|-------|-------------|--------|
| Snowflake Cortex | 20 | 3959 | COMPLETE - Reference model |
| Domo | 4 | 505 | Good coverage, needs organization |
| Power BI | 2 | 243 | Battle card + deep analysis |
| Tableau | 2 | 223 | Battle card + deep analysis |
| Zenlytic | 2 | 109 | Has sources folder |
| Tellius | 2 | 96 | Has sources folder |
| Sisense | 1 | 107 | Battle card only |
| Qlik | 1 | 105 | Battle card only |
| DataGPT | 1 | 96 | Battle card only |
| ThoughtSpot | 1 | 95 | Battle card only |
| DataChat | 1 | 94 | Battle card only |

### Key Findings
1. **Snowflake Cortex** is our gold standard with 20 files including:
   - Complete test suite (5+ Python scripts)
   - Multiple analysis documents
   - EventBrite presentation ready
   - Full journey documentation

2. **Most competitors** only have battle cards (1 file each)

3. **Archive recovery completed**:
   - Tableau DEEP_ANALYSIS.md restored (127 lines → 128 lines)
   - Power BI DEEP_ANALYSIS.md restored

4. **No deleted files** found in git history

5. **Marketing analysis** in archive mentions competitors but is general positioning

## PHASE 2 ARCHIVE RECOVERY COMPLETED

### Restored Content
- ✅ `tableau-pulse-vs-scoop.md` → `competitors/tableau-pulse/DEEP_ANALYSIS.md`
- ✅ `power-bi-copilot-vs-scoop.md` → `competitors/power-bi-copilot/DEEP_ANALYSIS.md`

### Archive Content Not Needed
- Marketing analysis files (general positioning, not competitor-specific)
- Webflow specs (implementation details, not intelligence)
- Planning history (process documentation)

---

## PHASE 3 PLAN - COMPETITOR DEEP REVIEWS

### Review Order (by completeness)
1. **Snowflake Cortex** - Verify as reference model
2. **Domo** - Organize 4 files into standard structure
3. **Tableau Pulse** - Add README, check completeness
4. **Power BI Copilot** - Add README, check completeness
5. **Remaining 7** - Each needs significant enhancement

### Standard Structure Target
```
[competitor]/
├── README.md           # Navigation
├── BATTLE_CARD.md      # Sales tool
├── DEEP_ANALYSIS.md    # Technical
├── EVIDENCE.md         # Proof URLs
├── PRICING.md          # Costs
├── USER_STORIES.md     # Feedback
└── tests/              # If applicable
```

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

Starting Phase 3 - Deep review of each competitor folder
- First: Snowflake Cortex (verify completeness)
- Then: Work through each competitor systematically
- Goal: Consistent, complete, accessible structure
