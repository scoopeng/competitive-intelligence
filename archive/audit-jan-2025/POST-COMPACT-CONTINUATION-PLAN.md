# Post-Compact Continuation Plan
## Critical Work to Resume After Compaction

---

## 1. INVESTIGATE ARCHIVED CONTENT (Priority: HIGH)

### Discovery:
We found significant content in archive folders that may contain deep analysis:
- **127 lines** in `archive/process-files/old-battle-cards/tableau-pulse-vs-scoop.md`
- Multiple archived folders with competitor analysis
- Marketing analysis in separate folder
- Framework documents not in main structure

### Action Items:
```bash
# Check archived content for each competitor
for competitor in tableau power-bi domo thoughtspot; do
    find archive -name "*${competitor}*" -type f
done

# Review archive structure
ls -R archive/ > archive_inventory.txt

# Compare current vs archived content size
for dir in competitors/*/; do
    echo "$(basename $dir): Current $(ls $dir | wc -l) files"
    find archive -name "*$(basename $dir)*" | wc -l
done
```

### Specific Investigations:
1. **Tableau**: Only has 1 file currently, but archive shows 127-line analysis
2. **Power BI**: Check for deeper analysis beyond battle card
3. **Domo**: Has 4 files but check if more in archive
4. **Marketing Analysis**: 3 files in marketing-analysis folder need integration

---

## 2. COMPLETE SNOWFLAKE BENCHMARK (Priority: HIGH)

### Current Status:
- ✅ Tested: 7 queries (23% of Scoop test suite)
- ❌ Not tested: 23+ queries (77% remaining)
- ⚠️ Cortex Analyst API failed (400 errors)
- ⚠️ Only CORTEX.COMPLETE worked (71% success)

### Remaining Test Categories:

#### A. Basic Tests Not Run:
- Distinct counts
- Multiple aggregations  
- Null handling
- Date filtering
- Range queries

#### B. Intermediate Tests Needed:
- Subqueries (critical for comparison)
- Window functions
- Cumulative calculations
- Period-over-period analysis
- Top N analysis
- Percentile calculations

#### C. Advanced Tests (Scoop Differentiators):
- Multi-step investigations
- Root cause analysis
- Correlation discovery
- Pattern recognition
- Predictive queries
- Trend analysis
- Anomaly detection
- Cohort analysis

#### D. ML/AI Tests (Scoop Unique):
- Decision tree analysis (J48)
- Rule learning (JRip)
- Clustering (EM)
- Association rules
- Feature importance

### Next Steps for Testing:
1. **Try Streamlit App in Snowsight**
   - Build UI for Cortex Analyst
   - Test if API works through Streamlit
   - Document complexity of building UI

2. **Test More CORTEX.COMPLETE Queries**
   ```python
   # Additional test queries from Scoop suite
   test_cases_remaining = [
       "Show top 5 customers by total charges",
       "Calculate month-over-month growth",
       "Find customers with declining usage",
       "Identify seasonal patterns",
       "Predict next month churn",
       # ... 20+ more queries
   ]
   ```

3. **Document Each Failure Category**
   - SQL syntax errors
   - Wrong column references
   - Type mismatches
   - Capability gaps

---

## 3. EVENTBRITE FOLLOW-UP (Priority: HIGH - Monday Meeting)

### Documents Ready:
- ✅ `EVENTBRITE-CORTEX-ANALYST-EVIDENCE.md` prepared
- ✅ Test results documented
- ✅ 4+ hour journey chronicled

### Post-Meeting Actions:
1. Document customer reaction
2. Capture objections raised
3. Update battle cards with real-world feedback
4. Create case study if successful

---

## 4. CONTENT RESTORATION PLAN

### Check Git History:
```bash
# Find all deleted/moved competitor files
git log --diff-filter=D --summary | grep -E "delete mode.*competitors"

# Find when content was moved to archive
git log --follow archive/

# Check for lost content in specific commits
git log --oneline --name-status | grep -E "^D.*tableau|power-bi|domo"
```

### Priority Restoration:
1. **Tableau** - Appears to have lost significant content
2. **Power BI** - Check for Copilot deep analysis
3. **ThoughtSpot** - Only 1 file but had 33.3% accuracy analysis
4. **Sisense** - 400% pricing increase documentation

### Structure Each Competitor Should Have:
```
competitors/[name]/
├── README.md          # Navigation guide
├── BATTLE_CARD.md     # Quick reference (from battle-cards/)
├── DEEP_ANALYSIS.md   # Technical deep dive
├── EVIDENCE.md        # Links and proof
├── PRICING.md         # Cost analysis
├── USER_STORIES.md    # Customer complaints/issues
└── test_scripts/      # If applicable
```

---

## 5. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS POST-COMPACT

### Hour 1: Restore Missing Content
```bash
# 1. Check what's in archive
find archive -type f -name "*.md" | wc -l

# 2. Move relevant content back
for file in archive/process-files/old-battle-cards/*.md; do
    competitor=$(basename $file | cut -d'-' -f1)
    cp $file competitors/$competitor/ARCHIVED_ANALYSIS.md
done

# 3. Verify nothing lost
git status
```

### Hour 2: Continue Snowflake Testing
- Set up Streamlit app in Snowsight
- Run next batch of 10 queries
- Document results

### Hour 3: Prepare Final EventBrite Package
- Review all documents
- Create executive summary
- Package test evidence

## 6. KEY QUESTIONS TO ANSWER

### About Archived Content:
1. Why was content moved to archive?
2. Is archived content still relevant/accurate?
3. Should we restore or keep archived?
4. What's the difference between current and archived versions?

### About Snowflake Testing:
1. Can we get real Cortex Analyst working (not just COMPLETE)?
2. Should we test all 30+ queries or is 23% enough?
3. Do we need to build Streamlit app to prove complexity?
4. What other evidence would strengthen our case?

### About Competitor Coverage:
1. Which competitors need more analysis?
2. Are battle cards sufficient or do we need deep dives?
3. Should we test other competitors like Domo, ThoughtSpot?
4. What evidence gaps exist?
