- **Power BI**: 15,074 words (2.5x longer, exhaustive)

### 2. PHILOSOPHY
- **Template**: "Tables > Prose, Show > Tell, Dense > Long"
- **Power BI**: Narrative-heavy, comprehensive, sales-focused

### 3. STRUCTURE
- **Template**: 7 clean sections, predictable flow
- **Power BI**: 5 "fields" with many subsections, complex hierarchy

### 4. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
- **Template**: Section 1 (800 words) with massive At-a-Glance table
- **Power BI**: Spread across Field 1 (3,000 words) without consolidated table

### 5. CAPABILITY SECTIONS
- **Template**:
  - 2.1 Investigation & Analysis
  - 2.2 Spreadsheet Engine (⚠️ MISSING in Power BI!)

  - 2.4 Setup & Implementation
  - 2.5 Schema Evolution (⚠️ ALWAYS REQUIRED)
  - 2.6 Accuracy & Reliability
  - 2.7 Integration & Workflow

- **Power BI**:

## WHAT'S MISSING IN POWER BI (vs Template)

### Critical Missing Sections
1. **Section 1: At-a-Glance Comparison Table**
   - Template has massive comparison table in Executive Summary
   - Power BI has scattered comparisons throughout

2. **Section 2.2: Spreadsheet Engine & Data Preparation (500 words)**
   - Template has dedicated section explaining 150+ Excel functions
   - Power BI mentions Excel formulas but no dedicated Spreadsheet Engine section

3. **Section 2.3: Three-Layer AI Data Scientist Architecture**
   - Template requires explaining Layer 1 (auto prep) + Layer 2 (real ML) + Layer 3 (AI explanation)
   - Power BI has ML examples but doesn't explain three-layer architecture

4. **Section 2.5: Schema Evolution & Maintenance (⚠️ ALWAYS INCLUDE)**
   - Template requires this as critical moat
   - Power BI has "Capability 2: Dynamic Schema Evolution" but buried in Section 2.3

5. **Section 4: Focused Use Cases (600 words)**
   - Template: Clean "when to choose" guidance
   - Power BI: Scattered across Field 3 (3,500 words)

6. **Section 5: Evidence & Sources (400 words)**
   - Template: Consolidated evidence section
   - Power BI: Evidence scattered throughout

7. **Section 6: FAQ (800 words)**
   - Template: Clean FAQ with specific questions
   - Power BI: No dedicated FAQ section

---

## WHAT'S EXTRA IN POWER BI (vs Template)

### Extra Content (Not in Template)
1. **Field 4: Competitive Intelligence & Win Strategies (1,500 words)**
   - Battle cards
   - Sales play patterns
   - Objection handling
   - Win/loss analysis
   - NOT in web template (this is for internal sales use)

2. **Field 5: Migration Guide & Success Framework (1,000 words)**
   - 8-week migration path
   - Change management playbook
   - Success metrics
   - NOT in web template (too detailed for web)

3. **Closing: The Decision Framework (500 words)**
   - Narrative closing
   - Template just has "Next Steps"

4. **Section 3.2: Comprehensive Department Impact Analysis**
   - ALL 9 departments covered
   - Template says 3-4 departments max

5. **"The Scoop Revolution" Section (~1,500 words)**
   - Standalone section between Field 1 and Field 2
   - Not in template structure

## ARCHITECTURAL ISSUES IN POWER BI

### 1. P-Value References (INCORRECT)
- Line 621: `CONFIDENCE: High (p < 0.001)`
- Line 686: `Statistical Significance: p < 0.001`
- **Should be**: ML model confidence scores, NOT hypothesis testing

### 2. =SCOOP() Function Reference (INCORRECT)
- Line 1319: `Excel (=SCOOP() function)`
- **Should be**: Google Sheets Plugin with utility functions

### 3. REST API References (INTERNAL ONLY)
- Lines 455, 1325, 1330: REST API listed as integration
- **Should remove**: mobileAPI is internal only

### 4. Three-Layer AI Architecture (INCOMPLETE)
- Power BI has ML examples (J48, EM) but doesn't explain the three-layer system
- Template requires: Layer 1 (auto prep) + Layer 2 (real ML, 800+ nodes) + Layer 3 (AI explanation)

### 5. Spreadsheet Engine (NOT EXPLAINED)
- Power BI mentions Excel formulas but no dedicated Spreadsheet Engine section
- Template requires: 150+ Excel functions, in-memory engine, skills-based approach

## DECISION: REWRITE OR UPDATE?

### Option 1: Complete Rewrite (RECOMMENDED)
**Use template to generate fresh Power BI comparison**
- **Pros**:
  - Clean structure alignment
  - Correct architecture throughout
  - Selective capability approach (5-7K words)
  - Table-dense, not prose-heavy
  - Proper Schema Evolution placement
  - Three-Layer AI properly explained
  - Spreadsheet Engine dedicated section
- **Cons**:
  - Lose Field 4 (sales content) and Field 5 (migration content)
  - Shorter (7K vs 15K words)
  - Need to archive old version

### Option 2: Major Update (COMPLEX)
**Restructure existing Power BI to match template**
- **Pros**:
  - Keep some existing research
  - Preserve Field 4/5 content separately
- **Cons**:
  - Extremely time-consuming
  - Trying to fit square peg in round hole
  - Still need to fix architecture throughout
  - Still need to add missing sections

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
**Generate new using template, archive old as "internal sales version"**
- **Pros**:
  - New version: Clean, web-focused, 5-7K words
  - Old version: Archived as comprehensive sales resource
  - Best of both worlds
- **Cons**:
  - Need to clearly label old version as internal-only

## RECOMMENDATION

**Generate fresh Power BI comparison using current template**

**Rationale**:
1. Template is now V2 (restructured September 2025)
2. Power BI comparison is from December 2024 (pre-restructure)
3. 15,074 words is 2.5x target length (bloated)
4. Missing critical sections (Spreadsheet Engine, Three-Layer AI)
5. Wrong architecture (p-values, =SCOOP(), REST API)
6. Field 4/5 content is sales-focused (not web content)

**Action Plan**:
1. Archive current Power BI web_comparison.md as web_comparison_v1_dec2024.md
2. Generate fresh using template (following selective capability approach)
3. Keep it focused: 5,000-7,000 words
4. Include only differentiating capabilities vs Power BI Copilot
5. Proper Three-Layer AI and Spreadsheet Engine sections
6. Clean structure: 7 sections as per template

**What to Keep from Old Version**:
- Research data (costs, accuracy issues, customer quotes)
- Evidence URLs
- Nondeterministic findings
- Congress ban information
- F64 capacity requirements

**What to Discard**:
- Field 4 (Competitive Intelligence) - move to battle card
- Field 5 (Migration Guide) - too detailed for web
- Bloated narrative sections
- All 9 departments (use 3-4 max)
- 5-year TCO (use 3-year)

**Result**: Clean, focused, architecturally correct web comparison at 5-7K words
