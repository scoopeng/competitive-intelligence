## Comparison to Old Version (v1_dec2024.md)

### Structure
- **Old**: 15,074 words, 5 "fields", 40+ subsections, sales-focused
- **New**: 7,198 words, 7 clean sections, web-focused
- **Improvement**: 2.1x more concise, better structure ✅

### Architecture
- **Old**: Missing Three-Layer AI, p-values present, =SCOOP() function, REST API
- **New**: Three-Layer AI explained, no p-values, correct architecture throughout
- **Improvement**: Architecturally accurate ✅

### Selective Approach
- **Old**: ALL 9 departments, 5-year TCO, exhaustive
- **New**: 3 departments, 3-year TCO, selective based on competitor
- **Improvement**: Follows template philosophy ✅

### Moat Emphasis
- **Old**: Schema Evolution mentioned but buried
- **New**: Schema Evolution as dedicated Section 2.5 with $1.4M 3-year savings quantified
- **Improvement**: Moat properly emphasized ✅

---

## Key Improvements Over Old Version

1. **Three-Layer AI Architecture** - Now properly explained (was missing)
2. **Spreadsheet Engine** - Dedicated section with 150+ functions (was scattered)
3. **Schema Evolution** - Section 2.5 with $1.4M moat quantification (was buried)
4. **Architectural Accuracy** - No p-values, no =SCOOP(), no REST API (all were wrong)
5. **Selective Approach** - 3 departments not 9, focused capabilities (was exhaustive)
6. **Structure** - 7 clean sections following template (was 5 complex fields)
7. **Length** - 7.2K words vs 15K (2.1x more focused)
8. **Table Density** - 15+ comparison tables (was prose-heavy)

---

## Final Verdict

✅ **PASSES ALL TEMPLATE REQUIREMENTS**

**Strengths**:
- Architecturally accurate (Three-Layer AI, Spreadsheet Engine)
- Table-dense (15+ comparison tables)
- Selective approach (3 departments, focused capabilities)
- Schema Evolution moat properly emphasized
- Evidence-based throughout
- Clean 7-section structure

**Notes**:
- 7,198 words (slightly over 7K target, but justified for Power BI complexity)
- Could add ML_PERIOD/ML_GROUP examples if desired (optional)
- CRM Writeback mentioned but not detailed (appropriate choice)

**Recommendation**: Ready for publication. This is a massive improvement over the 15K-word December 2024 version.
