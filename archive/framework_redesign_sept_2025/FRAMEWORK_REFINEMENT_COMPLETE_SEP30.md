## Summary

Completed comprehensive framework refinement addressing systematic overscoring and rubric clarity issues.

### What Was Done

1. **Understanding Dimension - Complete Revision** ✅
   - Rewrote all 3 components with precise agentic analytical criteria
   - Added "probe dependency" requirement as key differentiator
   - Rescored all 12 competitors using strict criteria
   - **Impact**: Scoop 18/20, Competitors 2-8/20 (accurate gap)

2. **Flow Dimension - Native Integration Clarification** ✅
   - Distinguished quality vs quantity of integrations
   - Clear progression: basic → full-featured → multiple full-featured
   - **Impact**: Prevents competitors from claiming equivalence for basic features

3. **Presentation Dimension - Brand Automation Clarification** ✅
   - Outcome-focused vs implementation-specific scoring
   - Clear progression: manual → template → extraction → intelligent
   - **Impact**: More defensible rubric measuring user burden reduction

### Results

**All 12 Competitors Rescored**:
- Scoop: 82/100 (unchanged, accurate)
- 8 competitors: Scores reduced by 2-12 points
- 2 competitors: Unchanged (already correct)

**All Pages Deployed**:
- 11 competitor pages live on Webflow
- BUA research document deployed (289K characters)
- All pages verified rendering correctly

**Documentation Complete**:
- Framework revised with clear rubrics
- 17 documents archived in organized structure
- Completion guides created for future maintenance
