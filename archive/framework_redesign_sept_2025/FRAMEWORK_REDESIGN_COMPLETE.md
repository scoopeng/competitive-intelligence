## Framework Structure

**5 Dimensions × 20 Points = 100 Total**

1. **Autonomy** (/20): Setup, Questions, Speed
2. **Flow** (/20): Native Integration, Portal Prison, Interface Simplicity
3. **Understanding** (/20): Investigation, ML, Explanation
4. **Presentation** (/20): Automatic Generation, Brand Control, Distribution
5. **Data** (/20): Multi-Source, Schema Evolution, Data Quality, Data Prep

## Files Updated

- **Framework scoring**: 12 files (all competitors)
- **Battle cards**: 11 files (all competitors except Scoop)
- **READMEs**: 11 files
- **Web comparisons**: 11 files (7,000+ words each)
- **Core framework**: 1 file
- **Total**: 46 files

## Mathematical Verification

✅ All 12 competitors verified: dimension sums = header totals

```
✓ scoop: 82 = 82
✓ power-bi-copilot: 32 = 32
✓ tableau-pulse: 37 = 37
✓ thoughtspot: 57 = 57
✓ snowflake-cortex: 26 = 26
✓ domo: 62 = 62
✓ qlik: 47 = 47
✓ zenlytic: 42 = 42
✓ sisense: 28 = 28
✓ datagpt: 22 = 22
