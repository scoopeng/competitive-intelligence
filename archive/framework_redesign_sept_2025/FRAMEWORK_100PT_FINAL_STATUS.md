# 100-Point Framework Final Status

**Date**: September 27, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE AND VERIFIED**

---

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Framework Rescaling ✅
- **From**: Arbitrary 59-point system (16+10+10+10+13)
- **To**: Clean 100-point system (5 dimensions × 20 points)
- **Benefit**: Intuitive percentages, better differentiation, honest Scoop positioning

### 2. All Files Updated ✅
- **12 framework_scoring.md files**: All dimensions rescaled to /20 structure
- **11 battle cards**: Updated to X/100 (Y%, Category Z) format
- **11 README files**: Updated scores and removed old references
- **11 web comparisons**: 7,000+ words each with new scoring
- **Core framework doc**: Updated to 100-point structure

### 3. Mathematical Verification ✅
All framework_scoring.md files now have correct math:
- Sub-components add to dimension totals (/20)
- All dimensions add to total score (/100)
- Categories match score ranges

### 4. Old References Removed ✅
- All "/50" and "/59" references removed from active files
- All "BUPAF" replaced with "BUA"
- Old category names updated (Marketing Mirage → proper categories)
