**Date**: September 28, 2025 (Evening)
**Status**: Ready to execute final 4 competitors
**Context**: Compact failed - use this document to resume in fresh conversation

---

## Current State: 7 of 11 Complete (64%)

### ✅ Deployed & QA Verified (Grade A, 9/10 average)
1. Power BI Copilot (32/100, D) - 8,450 words - v2.0 strategy
2. Snowflake Cortex (26/100, C) - 8,608 words - v1.1 strategy
3. Tableau Pulse (37/100, C) - 6,568 words - v1.1 strategy
4. Zenlytic (42/100, C) - 8,151 words - v1.1 strategy
5. ThoughtSpot (57/100, B) - 8,969 words - v1.1 strategy
6. Domo (62/100, B) - 8,699 words - v1.1 strategy
7. Qlik (47/100, C) - 8,361 words - v1.1 strategy

**Total**: 59,806 words deployed, all following v1.1 strategy + v2.1 template framework

---

## Remaining: 4 Tier 2 Competitors

### Priority Order (Lowest to Highest BUA)
1. **DataChat**: 17/100 (D, Category F) - Lowest score, minimal market presence
2. **DataGPT**: 22/100 (D, Category F) - Single-source limitation
3. **Tellius**: 22/100 (D, Category F) - Apache Spark crashes, low adoption
4. **Sisense**: 28/100 (C, Category C) - Embedded analytics focus

### Why Tier 2?
- Lower BUA scores (17-28 vs 26-62 for Tier 1)
- Less market presence and deal frequency
- Weaker competitors = easier to position against
- Can follow proven framework from Tier 1

---

## Proven Framework (Use This Process)

### Step 1: Create Competitive Strategy (v1.1)
**For each competitor**:
1. Review existing research in `/competitors/[name]/`
2. Read BUA scoring in `/competitors/[name]/evidence/framework_scoring.md`
3. Read battle card in `/competitors/[name]/BATTLE_CARD.md`
4. Do additional web research to validate/update findings
5. Create `/competitors/[name]/COMPETITIVE_STRATEGY.md` using template at `/competitors/SHARED/COMPETITIVE_STRATEGY_TEMPLATE.md`

**Template v1.1 Requirements**:
- Rank top 3 weaknesses with defensibility classification (Architectural/Temporal/Strategic)
- Allocate emphasis levels (typically 30%/25%/20% for top 3)
- Include key scenarios with customer stories
- Provide talking points (lead with, always mention, de-emphasize)
- Content distribution plan for web comparison
- Win conditions and competitive positioning
- Avoid over-claiming section

### Step 2: Generate Web Comparison (v2.1)
**Use Task tool with general-purpose agent**:
```
"Generate web comparison for [competitor] following:
- Competitive strategy at /competitors/[name]/COMPETITIVE_STRATEGY.md
- Template at /templates/WEB_COMPARISON_TEMPLATE.md
- Evidence at /competitors/[name]/evidence/framework_scoring.md
- Target: 7,500+ words
- Follow strategic emphasis allocation
- Use v2.1 features (Question Hierarchy, Semantic Model Boundary if applicable)
- Professional credible tone"
```

### Step 3: Update Documentation
After each competitor:
- Update `COMPETITOR_STATUS.md` with progress
- Note key insights in `CHANGELOG.md` if patterns emerge

---

## Key Learnings from Tier 1 (Apply to Tier 2)

### What Worked Exceptionally Well ✅
1. **Strategic emphasis allocation**: Follow competitive strategy doc (30%/25%/20%)
2. **Evidence-based positioning**: Customer quotes, specific numbers, timelines
3. **Investigation-first positioning**: Multi-pass vs single-query clear across all
4. **Professional credible tone**: Acknowledge competitor strengths, not overly aggressive
5. **Architectural framing**: Position as architectural limitations, not just feature gaps
6. **Task tool for generation**: High-quality web comparisons with explicit instructions

### Quality Standards Achieved
- All 7 deployments: Grade A (9/10 average)
- Zero critical issues found
- Strategic emphasis followed precisely
- Professional tone maintained
- Investigation capabilities clearly explained

### Common Patterns Identified
1. **YAML/Semantic Layer Dependency**: Snowflake Cortex, Zenlytic (IT must maintain definitions)
2. **Portal Prison**: All dashboard-first competitors (no native Excel/Slack/PowerPoint)
3. **Text-to-SQL = One Query**: Cannot do multi-pass investigation (7+ queries)
4. **Schema Brittleness**: Tableau Pulse (400 errors), semantic layers break on changes
5. **Search vs Investigation**: ThoughtSpot ex-Google heritage
6. **Bolt-On LLM**: Domo (2010s dashboard + 2024 LLM layer)
7. **Legacy Migration Pain**: Qlik desktop/on-premise origins struggling with cloud

---

## Tier 2 Specific Considerations

### Lower BUA Scores = Different Emphasis
- Tier 1: 26-62/100 (Categories B-D)
- Tier 2: 17-28/100 (Categories C-F)
- **Implication**: Even weaker competitors, easier to position against

### Focus Areas for Tier 2
1. **Minimal market presence**: Use market share data, adoption rates
2. **Fundamental capability gaps**: Not just feature differences, but missing core capabilities
3. **Niche focus limitations**: Embedded analytics (Sisense), single-source (DataGPT)
4. **Technical failures**: Spark crashes (Tellius), minimal functionality (DataChat)

### Estimated Time per Competitor
- Strategy creation: 30-45 minutes (research + writing)
- Web comparison generation: 15-20 minutes (Task tool)
- Total per competitor: 45-65 minutes
- **Full batch**: 3-4 hours for all 4 competitors

---

## Execution Plan for Fresh Conversation

### Option A: Sequential Execution (Recommended)
```
1. Create DataChat strategy (lowest score, quickest)
2. Generate DataChat web comparison
3. Create Tellius strategy
4. Generate Tellius web comparison
5. Create DataGPT strategy
6. Generate DataGPT web comparison
7. Create Sisense strategy (highest Tier 2 score, most complex)
8. Generate Sisense web comparison
9. Update all documentation
10. Commit to git
```

### Option B: Batch Strategies, Then Batch Comparisons
```
1. Create all 4 strategies (DataChat, Tellius, DataGPT, Sisense)
2. Review and refine strategies
3. Generate all 4 web comparisons using Task tool (parallel if possible)
4. Update documentation
5. Commit to git
```

**Recommendation**: Option A (sequential) for quality control and context management

## Starting the Fresh Conversation

### Recommended Opening Message
```
"Resume Tier 2 final push. Read TIER_2_HANDOFF.md for full context.

Current state:
- 7 of 11 competitors complete and deployed (Tier 1 done)
- 4 remaining: DataChat (17/100), DataGPT (22/100), Tellius (22/100), Sisense (28/100)
- Proven framework from Tier 1 (Grade A, 9/10 average quality)

Execute sequential approach:
1. Create competitive strategy for each (v1.1 template)
2. Generate web comparison for each (v2.1 template, 7,500+ words)
3. Update documentation
4. Commit to git

Start with DataChat (lowest score, easiest positioning)."
```

## Final Notes

### What Makes This Easy
- ✅ Proven framework from Tier 1 (7 successful completions)
- ✅ Clear templates (v1.1 strategy, v2.1 web comparison)
- ✅ Existing research for all 4 competitors
- ✅ Lower BUA scores = easier to position against
- ✅ Task tool generates high-quality comparisons

### What to Watch For
- ⚠️ Lower market presence = less public information available
