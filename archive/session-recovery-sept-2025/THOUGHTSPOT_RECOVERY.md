# ThoughtSpot Research Recovery Document
**Created**: September 25, 2025
**Purpose**: Resume ThoughtSpot research after context reset

## üéØ CRITICAL: ThoughtSpot is Only 25% Complete

### What's Already Done
- Basic BATTLE_CARD.md exists
- Some initial research in DEEP_ANALYSIS.md
- 33.3% accuracy benchmark found (vs Lumi AI)
- BUPAF scored at 23/50

### What's Missing (Priority Order)
1. **Full 4-Phase Research Template**: Need to execute complete template
2. **Phase 1 - Customer Discovery**: All 17 searches for horror stories
3. **Phase 2 - Functionality Analysis**: Map against Scoop capabilities
4. **Phase 3 - Technical Reality**: 24 searches on performance/integration
5. **Phase 4 - Sales Enablement**: Update BUPAF with evidence

## üìã Next Session Plan for ThoughtSpot

### Step 1: Check Existing Assets (5 min)
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/dev/competitive-intelligence
cat THOUGHTSPOT_RECOVERY.md  # This file
cat SCOOP_CAPABILITIES.md     # Read first!
cd competitors/thoughtspot/
ls -la
cat README.md
cat BATTLE_CARD.md
find . -name "*.md" -type f
```

### Step 2: Create Research Checklist (2 min)
```bash
cp ../../COMPETITOR_RESEARCH_TEMPLATE.md RESEARCH_CHECKLIST.md
# Replace {COMPETITOR} with ThoughtSpot throughout
```

### Step 3: Execute Phase 0 - Archive Check (5 min)
- Check archive/ for any ThoughtSpot files
- Check existing research/ folder
- Document what exists

### Step 4: Execute Phase 1 - Customer Discovery (40-50 min)
All 17 searches:
- G2, Capterra, TrustRadius reviews
- Reddit r/BusinessIntelligence
- LinkedIn professional perspectives
- Industry verticals (healthcare, finance, retail, manufacturing, government)

### Step 5: Execute Phase 2 - Functionality (35-40 min)
Compare to Scoop's differentiators:
- Excel formula support (likely none)
- Multi-pass investigation (probably single query)
- ML capabilities (what type?)
- Workflow integration (Slack? PowerPoint?)
- Setup time (likely weeks/months)

### Step 6: Execute Phase 3 - Technical Reality (40-45 min)
All 24 searches covering:
- Performance & response times
- Memory & resource requirements
- API availability
- Integration capabilities
- Competitive positioning
- True costs & ROI

### Step 7: Execute Phase 4 - Sales Enablement (20 min)
- Update BUPAF scoring with evidence
- Create competitive matrix
- Industry-specific strategies
- Fatal flaws positioning

## üîç Key Things to Research

### Known Issues to Validate
- **33.3% accuracy** benchmark (verify and expand)
- **"OG copilot"** positioning (built before LLMs)
- Natural language from ground up (not retrofit)
- Search paradigm vs dashboard paradigm

### Expected Pain Points to Find
- Likely no Excel integration
- Probably single-query only
- Enterprise pricing (expect $100k+)
- Complex implementation
- Limited workflow integration

### Competitive Positioning
- Position as "old technology" despite "OG" status
- 33.3% accuracy is devastating evidence
- Compare to Scoop's multi-pass and Excel engine
- Likely expensive with long implementation

## üìÅ File Structure to Create
```
competitors/thoughtspot/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ RESEARCH_CHECKLIST.md      # From template
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ evidence/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ phase1_customer_discovery.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ phase2_functionality_analysis.md

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ outputs/                    # Future web content
```

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria
- Complete all 4 phases with evidence
- Update BUPAF score with proof
- Find 5+ customer horror stories
- Document true costs
- Map all capabilities vs Scoop
- Create killer battle card update

## üöÄ Quick Start Commands
```bash
# After context reset:
cd /home/ubuntu/dev/competitive-intelligence
cat THOUGHTSPOT_RECOVERY.md
cat SCOOP_CAPABILITIES.md
cd competitors/thoughtspot/
cp ../../COMPETITOR_RESEARCH_TEMPLATE.md RESEARCH_CHECKLIST.md
# Then start Phase 0
```
