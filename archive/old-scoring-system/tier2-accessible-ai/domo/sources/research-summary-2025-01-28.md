# Domo Research Summary
**Date**: January 28, 2025
**Sources Analyzed**: 18+
**Research Time**: 2 hours

## Executive Summary
Domo is a cloud BI platform with dashboards and basic statistics marketed as "AI." Their "Mr. Roboto" AI (launched 2017) is just correlations and outlier detection. With average enterprise costs of $134K annually, unpredictable consumption-based pricing, and documented 1120% renewal increases, Domo epitomizes expensive complexity sold as innovation.

## Key Discoveries

### 1. Fake AI Exposed
- "Mr. Roboto" = basic statistics (correlations, outliers, trends)
- Matrix factorization marketed as "machine learning"
- 7+ years old with no AI advancement
- R/Python tiles = bring your own data science
- No real ML models or algorithms

### 2. Pricing Nightmare
- Average enterprise: $134K/year (Vendr data)
- Consumption model = unpredictable costs
- User licenses: $750/year PLUS credits
- Documented 1120% renewal increase
- No cost forecasting or controls

### 3. Not Self-Service
- 1-2+ month implementations
- "Business users will find it complicated"
- AI needs "significant data modeling" first
- Performance degrades with data size
- Small businesses explicitly ignored

### 4. Platform Reality
- 1,000+ connectors = integration project
- Dashboard-first approach
- "Half-baked" AI per users
- Requires data engineer team
- Support complaints common

## Evidence Collection

### Marketing vs Reality
| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| "AI-powered platform" | Statistics from 1990s |
| "No technical skills needed" | Requires data engineers |
| "Predictive analytics" | Basic regression |
| "Consumption pricing flexibility" | Budget spirals |

### Actual Costs Documented
- Mid-size: $20K-$50K/year
- Enterprise: $50K-$100K+ typical
- Maximum seen: $1.55 million
- Renewal increases: 2-3x common, 11x documented

### User Experience Quotes
- "Business users will find it complicated"
- "To get AI to work, needs significant data prep"
- "Platform becomes very disorganized"
- "Prohibitively expensive"

### AI Reality Check
**Mr. Roboto "AI" features**:
1. Trends (basic statistics)
2. Correlations (Statistics 101)
3. Outliers (standard deviation)
4. Market basket (1990s technique)

**Missing**: Any actual machine learning

## Competitive Positioning

### Why Scoop Wins
1. **Real AI vs Statistics**: Investigation engine vs correlations
2. **$3,588 vs $134,000**: 97% cost savings
3. **Predictable vs Spiraling**: Fixed pricing vs consumption chaos
4. **30 seconds vs 2 months**: Instant value vs projects
5. **Self-service vs Engineers**: Empowerment vs dependency

### Discovery Questions
1. "How much did your last renewal increase?"
2. "Can you predict next month's Domo bill?"
3. "How many data engineers manage Domo?"
4. "What ML algorithms does Mr. Roboto use?"
5. "How long was your implementation?"

### Red Flags to Listen For
- "Consumption model gives flexibility"
- "Working with IT on dashboards"
- "Credits are hard to predict"
- "Still in implementation"
- "Need to model data first"

## Smoking Guns
1. 1120% renewal increase documented
2. Mr. Roboto unchanged since 2017
3. No actual ML algorithms identified
4. Admits needing data science consultants
5. Small businesses told they're not target

## Next Research Steps
- [ ] Get screenshots of credit consumption
- [ ] Find more renewal shock stories
- [ ] Document Mr. Roboto limitations
- [ ] Capture dashboard-first approach
- [ ] Get performance degradation examples

## Conclusion
Domo perfectly represents Tier 1 "AI Pretenders" - a traditional dashboard platform with 1990s statistics branded as AI, sold through consumption pricing that spirals out of control. At 40x Scoop's cost with 1/10th the AI capabilities, Domo proves expensive complexity doesn't equal innovation.
