## 3. Investigation Capabilities (The Core Differentiator)

### Multi-Hypothesis Testing

**Scoop's Investigation Engine**:
```
User: "Why did sales drop in Q3?"

Scoop executes:
1. Seasonality analysis (3 queries)
2. Product mix changes (2 queries)
3. Customer segment shifts (2 queries)
4. Regional variations (2 queries)
5. Correlation discovery (1 query)
= 10 interconnected probes with synthesis
```

**Domo's Single Query**:
```
User: "Why did sales drop in Q3?"

Domo response:
- Error: Cannot answer "why" questions
- OR: Shows Q3 sales number only
```

### Probe Dependencies & Reasoning

**Scoop's Capabilities**:
- **extraction_rules**: Use probe 1 results in probe 2
- **use_previous_results**: Full context awareness
- **depends_on**: Parallel execution optimization
- **Synthesis**: Combines all findings into narrative

**Domo's Limitations**:
- Single SQL query execution
- No hypothesis testing
- No probe dependencies
- No synthesis capability

## 8. Sales Positioning Recommendations

### The Elevator Pitch
"Domo requires IT setup, works in a portal, and does one query at a time. Scoop works in Slack, uploads CSVs in 30 seconds, investigates with 10 queries automatically, and creates your PowerPoint. Which would your business users prefer?"

### The Three Questions That Win

1. **"How long before a business user can analyze their own CSV?"**
   - Scoop: 30 seconds
   - Domo: Days (Workbench setup required)

2. **"Can your sales team get answers in Slack during a customer call?"**
   - Scoop: Yes, natively
   - Domo: No, portal only

3. **"When the CEO asks 'why', how many queries to find out?"**
   - Scoop: 3-10 automatically
   - Domo: One at a time, manually

### The Demo Moment
"Let me show you something Domo can't do. Watch me drop this CSV in Slack, ask why sales dropped, and get a PowerPoint in 60 seconds. Domo would need Workbench installed, data configured, and then could only show you what dropped, not why."

## 9. Objection Handlers

**"Domo has AI Chat too"**
"Yes, for single queries. When you ask 'why did sales drop?', Domo shows the drop. Scoop investigates 10 different factors automatically and tells you it was payment gateway failures in the Northeast affecting enterprise accounts."

**"Domo has 1000+ connectors"**
"Great for IT projects. But can your sales manager upload their CSV without calling IT? With Scoop, they drop it in Slack and start asking questions immediately."

**"Domo is more established"**
"Established in dashboards. But your business users don't want to build dashboards - they want answers in Slack, presentations for meetings, and Excel formulas that work. That's Scoop."

## 10. The Bottom Line

Domo is a capable BI platform that added chat to dashboards. Scoop is a Digital Data Analyst that lives where business users work, thinks like they think, and delivers what they need.

**The fundamental difference**:
- Domo: IT configures → Dashboards built → Users query → Manual export
- Scoop: Users upload → AI investigates → Insights delivered → Auto PowerPoint

**Time savings per user per week**:
- Data upload: 2 hours saved
- Investigation: 4 hours saved  
- Report creation: 3 hours saved
- **Total: 9 hours/week per user**

At scale, Scoop doesn't just save money - it fundamentally changes how businesses operate with data.
