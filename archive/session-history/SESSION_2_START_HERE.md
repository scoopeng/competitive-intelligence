# SESSION 2 - START HERE FOR SEAMLESS CONTINUATION

**Context**: Continuing BUPAF competitive intelligence reorganization after Session 1 compact.

## What Was Accomplished (Session 1)

### ✅ Phase 0: Complete
- Audited 106+ existing files
- Created EXISTING_RESEARCH_AUDIT.md
- Identified business user gaps

### ✅ Phase 1: 75% Complete
- Created BUSINESS_USER_POWER_FRAMEWORK.md (4-dimension scoring)
- Created QUICK_COMPARISON_MATRIX.md (initial scores)
- Created folder structure for new categories
- Updated for schema evolution discovery

### 🔥 CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Schema Evolution
**Scoop's unique capability** (found in ReportSeriesTableUpdater.java):
- Automatically handles schema changes (ALTER TABLE, migrations)
- Business users can add/remove columns without breaking anything
- All historical data preserved through changes
- NO COMPETITOR HAS THIS - they all require IT for schema changes
- This is a 10/10 vs 0/10 differentiator

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### 1. Read These Files First:
```bash
1. cat /home/brad-peters/dev/competitive-intelligence/BUPAF_EXECUTION_PLAN.md
2. cat /home/brad-peters/dev/competitive-intelligence/PROGRESS_LOG.md
3. cat /home/brad-peters/dev/competitive-intelligence/BUSINESS_USER_POWER_FRAMEWORK.md
```

### 2. Begin Tableau Pulse Analysis:
```bash
# Read existing research
cat /home/brad-peters/dev/competitive-intelligence/tier1-ai-pretenders/tableau-pulse/README.md

# Check sources
ls /home/brad-peters/dev/competitive-intelligence/tier1-ai-pretenders/tableau-pulse/sources/

# Create new analysis
vim /home/brad-peters/dev/competitive-intelligence/category-d-mirages/tableau-pulse/bupaf-analysis.md
```

### 3. BUPAF Scoring Focus for Tableau Pulse:

#### Independence (Expected: 3/10)
- ❌ Requires Tableau Cloud setup by IT
- ❌ Needs semantic model definition
- ❌ Business users can't upload data
- ❌ Can't handle schema changes

#### Analytical Depth (Expected: 2/10)
- ❌ No investigation capability
- ❌ Alerts only, no root cause
- ❌ No ML/prediction
- ✅ Basic anomaly detection

#### Workflow Integration (Expected: 3/10)
- ❌ NO SCHEMA EVOLUTION (major weakness)
- ❌ No Excel integration
- ❌ No PowerPoint generation
- ⚠️ Slack notifications only

#### Business Communication (Expected: 4/10)
- ⚠️ Natural language descriptions
- ❌ No narrative generation
- ❌ No recommendations
- ⚠️ Basic visualizations

### 4. Key Evidence to Find:
- Schema/data management limitations
- Setup complexity for business users
- What happens when data structure changes
- Real user reviews about accessibility
- Actual capabilities vs marketing claims

### 5. Battle Card Key Points:
- **Scoop**: Automatic schema evolution, business users manage own data
- **Tableau**: IT must handle ALL data changes, queries break on schema changes
- **Scoop**: Multi-pass investigation engine
- **Tableau**: Single metric alerts only

## Success Criteria for Session 2

1. Complete Tableau Pulse BUPAF analysis
2. Update comparison matrix with final scores
3. Create battle card with schema evolution emphasis
4. Move to Power BI Copilot if time permits

## Remember
- BUILD ON existing research, don't replace
- EMPHASIZE schema evolution advantage
- SCORE with evidence for every point
- UPDATE tracking documents as you go
