```

### The Cross-Department Collaboration

**Traditional Journey**:
1. Export from BI tool
2. Format in Excel

## The Ultimate Truth

**We don't win on features. We win on workflows.**

Every competitor can add chat. None can eliminate the BI→Excel→PowerPoint→Email workflow because that's not a product problem - it's an architecture problem.

We built for how people actually work, not how IT wishes they worked.

That's why users choose us every morning.
