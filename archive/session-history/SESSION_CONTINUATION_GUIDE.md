# Competitive Intelligence - Session Continuation Guide

**Last Updated**: January 29, 2025  
**Purpose**: Guide for continuing research across sessions and tracking progress

## Project Overview

Building comprehensive competitive intelligence library for Scoop Analytics with:
- **Deep analysis** of 15+ competitors across 3 tiers
- **Evidence-based** findings with source documentation
- **Dual focus**: Setup ease AND post-setup advantages

## Current Research Status

### âœ… Framework Complete
- Research methodology documented
- Tier-based folder structure established
- Source documentation standards defined
- Competitor classifications clear

### âœ… Competitors Analyzed (12 of 15+)

#### Tier 1: AI Pretenders (6 Complete)
1. **Tableau Pulse** - No ML, just metric alerts ($165K/year)
2. **Power BI Copilot** - DAX formula generator ($54K+/year)
3. **Qlik Insight Advisor** - Zero adoption after 5+ years
4. **DataChat** - No user reviews after 7 years
5. **Sisense** - ARIMA forecasting, 400% renewal increases
6. **MicroStrategy** - 35-year ROLAP + 2024 chatbot

#### Tier 2: Accessible AI (3 Complete)
7. **DataGPT** - Real AI, 85% adoption, but single-source only
8. **Domo** - AI Chat (2024) within dashboard context
9. **Snowflake Cortex** - Text-to-SQL for Snowflake data only

#### Tier 3: Real AI but Inaccessible (3 Complete)
10. **ThoughtSpot** - Real ML but $140K+/year
11. **Tellius** - Root cause analysis, $100K+, too complex
12. **Zenlytic** - YAML/SQL required, opposite of self-service

### ðŸ“‹ Remaining Competitors
- **H2O.ai** - Extremely technical (Tier 3)
- **C3 AI** - Massive implementation (Tier 3)
- **Akkio** - Claims no-code AI (investigate tier)
- **Obviously AI** - AutoML for business (investigate tier)
- **Pecan AI** - Predictive analytics focus (investigate tier)

## Critical Research Focus Areas

### 1. Post-Setup Advantages (Priority)
**Key Insight**: We have TWO competitive advantages:
- **Setup Advantage**: Non-IT can set up Scoop âœ… (documented)
- **Post-Setup Advantage**: Superior AI and workflow âœ… (documented)

### 2. Evidence Needed
- Screenshots of competitor limitations
- Workflow comparison diagrams
- Time-to-insight measurements
- Customer testimonials with both platforms

### 3. Key Differentiators to Emphasize
- **Investigation Engine**: Multi-hypothesis testing vs single queries
- **Business Utility**: PowerPoint, decks, saved queries
- **Native Integration**: Slack vs separate portals
- **Complete Workflow**: Question â†’ Investigation â†’ Presentation

## Next Session Instructions

### If Continuing Research:
1. Check this guide for current status
2. Review `TIER_CLASSIFICATIONS.md` for competitor placement
3. Use `COMPETITOR_RESEARCH_TEMPLATE.md` for new competitors
4. Focus on post-setup advantages for all analyses

### If Refining Existing:
1. Add screenshots to existing analyses
2. Enhance post-setup advantage sections
3. Update battle cards with daily workflow comparisons
4. Gather more customer testimonials

### Quick Commands:
```bash
# See all competitors
ls -la tier*/*/README.md

# Check research progress
grep "Completion:" tier*/*/README.md

# Find specific competitor
find . -name "*thoughtspot*" -type d

# Search for keywords
grep -r "investigation engine" --include="*.md"
```

## Key Patterns Discovered

### Market Reality:
- **64%** are AI pretenders (Tier 1) - fake AI, real costs
- **25%** have real AI but it's inaccessible (Tier 3) 
- **11%** are legitimate competitors (Tier 2) - but with major gaps

### Scoop's Unique Position:
Only solution combining:
1. Real investigation engine (not just queries)
2. True self-service (no IT dependency)
3. Complete business workflow
4. Affordable pricing

## Critical Next Steps

### High Priority:
1. Complete remaining competitor analyses (5 left)
2. Create visual workflow comparisons
3. Build ROI calculators
4. Develop "day in the life" scenarios

### Medium Priority:
1. Gather screenshot evidence
2. Create competitor migration guides
3. Build objection handling library
4. Develop demo scripts

## Remember: Quality Over Speed

Each competitor needs:
- 85%+ completion with deep analysis
- Evidence from 15-20 sources
- Both positive and negative findings
- Clear positioning against Scoop
- Post-setup advantage analysis

## Magic Prompt for Continuation

```
Continue the competitive intelligence project at /home/ubuntu/dev/competitive-intelligence/

Current status: 12 competitors analyzed, 5 remaining. Focus on maintaining quality while completing analyses. 

For new competitors: Follow the template, gather 15-20 sources, analyze both setup AND post-setup advantages.

For refinements: Add screenshots, enhance post-setup sections, create battle cards.

Key message: Scoop wins on investigation depth, workflow completeness, and daily user experience - not just setup ease.
