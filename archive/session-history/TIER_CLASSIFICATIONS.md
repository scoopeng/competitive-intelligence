# Competitor Tier Classifications

**Last Updated**: January 29, 2025  
**Purpose**: Source of truth for competitor tier placement and criteria

## Tier Definitions

### Tier 1: AI Pretenders
**Criteria**:
- Claims AI/ML but only has rules, templates, or basic statistics
- No real machine learning or investigation capabilities
- Generates formulas/dashboards, not insights
- Requires IT/BI teams despite "self-service" claims
- Often has hidden massive costs

**Positioning**: "They have fake AI, we have real ML"

### Tier 2: Accessible AI (Limited Scope)
**Criteria**:
- Has legitimate AI/conversational capabilities
- Business users can actually use it
- BUT missing critical features or scope
- May be limited to single data sources or specific contexts
- Proves market need while showing limitations

**Positioning**: "They're a feature, we're a platform"

### Tier 3: Real AI but Inaccessible
**Criteria**:
- Legitimate ML/AI capabilities
- Powerful analytics and insights
- BUT requires data teams and expertise
- Enterprise pricing ($100K-$300K+/year)
- Long implementations (weeks to months)
- Low adoption due to complexity

**Positioning**: "Same AI, 10x more accessible"

## Current Tier Assignments

### Tier 1: AI Pretenders (6 companies)
1. **Tableau Pulse** - Metric alerts only, no ML
2. **Power BI Copilot** - DAX formula generator
3. **Qlik Insight Advisor** - Rule-based suggestions
4. **DataChat** - Vague claims, no evidence
5. **Sisense** - ARIMA forecasting only
6. **MicroStrategy** - Chatbot on old ROLAP

### Tier 2: Accessible AI (3 companies)
1. **DataGPT** - Fast queries, 85% adoption, but single-source only
2. **Domo** - AI Chat (2024) within dashboard context
3. **Snowflake Cortex** - Text-to-SQL for Snowflake data only

### Tier 3: Real AI but Inaccessible (3 companies)
1. **ThoughtSpot** - Real ML, $140K+/year, complex
2. **Tellius** - Root cause analysis, requires data team
3. **Zenlytic** - YAML/SQL configuration required

## Reclassification History

### Domo (January 28, 2025)
- **Original**: Tier 1 (AI Pretender)
- **Reclassified**: Tier 2 (Accessible AI)
- **Reason**: Discovered they launched AI Chat in 2024 with legitimate conversational capabilities
- **Limitation**: Still dashboard-centric, can't investigate beyond pre-built context
