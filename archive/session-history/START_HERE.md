# Competitive Intelligence Research - START HERE

**Location**: `/home/ubuntu/dev/competitive-intelligence/`

## üéØ CRITICAL FOCUS: Powerful AI + Business User Accessible

**Scoop's Dual Advantage**:
1. **REAL AI/ML**: 4 ML models, investigation engine, pattern discovery, multi-hypothesis testing
2. **BUSINESS USER READY**: Sales/Marketing/CS can use it without training in Slack

**The Competition's Problem**: Either fake AI (Tableau Pulse) OR real AI that needs data scientists (ThoughtSpot)

## üîç Research Methodology: EXHAUSTIVE & THOROUGH

**This is a multi-month project requiring dozens of passes per competitor.**

For EVERY source you examine:
1. Create individual source document with COMPLETE extraction
2. Include ALL information - positive, negative, technical, business
3. Direct quotes, specific numbers, exact claims
4. These source docs should be so thorough they replace the original

**Expected pace**: 
- 3-5 sources per hour MAX (quality over speed)
- 20-30 source documents per competitor
- Multiple days per competitor
- Hundreds of hours total

## üöÄ Magic Prompt to Start Any Session

Copy and paste this:
```
I need to research Scoop's competitors. The project is at /home/ubuntu/dev/competitive-intelligence/

CRITICAL: Evaluate both technical capabilities AND business user accessibility.

Current status: 8 competitors analyzed, 7+ more to research. See COMPACT_CONTINUATION.md for details.

For each competitor analyze:

TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES:
1. Do they have REAL ML/AI? (clustering, prediction, classification, time analysis)
2. Can they discover patterns or just report metrics?
3. Do they investigate "why" with multi-hypothesis testing?
4. Is there an actual investigation engine or just Q&A?

BUSINESS USER ACCESSIBILITY:
1. Can a sales person use it WITHOUT training?
2. Do they work where users work (Slack) or need another portal?
3. Do users get INSIGHTS or technical output (DAX/SQL)?
4. How long before first real answer? (30 seconds or 30 days?)

Compare to Scoop which has BOTH:
- Real ML models + investigation engine
- AND true self-service for business users

Focus on why competitors fail at one or both.

## üéØ The Hit List (Tech + User Perspective)

**Tier 1: "AI Pretenders"** (No real AI, still need BI teams)
1. Tableau Pulse - Just alerts, no ML, business users wait for IT
2. Power BI Copilot - DAX generator, no discovery, for analysts only
3. Qlik Insight Advisor - Basic Q&A, no investigation, portal required

**Tier 3: Real Competition** (Real AI but not self-service)
4. ThoughtSpot - Has ML but $140K+ and needs data modeling
5. Tellius - Real root cause but enterprise complexity
6. Zenlytic - Some ML but requires YAML configuration
7. DataGPT - Conversational but depth unclear
8. DataChat - Claims both but execution unclear

**Others**: Mix of fake AI and complex tools

## üì∏ Evidence Checklist

For EVERY competitor document:

**Technical Capabilities**:
- [ ] ML/AI models present? Which ones?
- [ ] Pattern discovery capability?
- [ ] Root cause analysis?
- [ ] Multi-hypothesis testing?
- [ ] Statistical significance?
- [ ] Predictive capabilities?

**Business User Access**:
- [ ] Where do they start? (Slack/Portal/App)
- [ ] Output format? (Insights vs formulas)
- [ ] Setup requirements? (IT needed?)
- [ ] Training required? (Hours/Days)
- [ ] Time to first answer?
- [ ] What they CAN'T do alone?

## üí° What We're Proving

**Scoop is the ONLY solution with BOTH**:

**Powerful AI Capabilities**:
- Real ML models (clustering, prediction, classification, time analysis)
- Investigation engine with multi-hypothesis testing
- Pattern discovery and anomaly detection
- Statistical significance testing
- Transparent reasoning process

**AND True Business User Access**:
- Start in Slack (no new tools)
- Natural conversation with memory
- Insights not formulas
- 30-second setup
- Zero training required
- No IT dependency

**Everyone else fails because**:
- Tier 1: No real AI (just chatbots/alerts)
- Tier 3: Real AI but requires data scientists
- All: Business users can't actually use them

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

Good research proves:
1. Technical capabilities (or lack thereof)
2. Business user accessibility (or lack thereof)
3. Why Scoop is unique in having BOTH
4. Specific evidence of failures
5. Clear competitive positioning

## üé¨ Output Structure

Each competitor folder contains:
1. **README.md** - THOROUGH analysis (3-5 pages)
   - Executive summary with dual focus
   - Technical capability assessment
   - Business user experience analysis
   - Detailed evidence of limitations
   - Sales positioning and battle cards
   
2. **sources/** folder
   - research-summary-YYYY-MM-DD.md
   - All findings with links and quotes
   
3. **evidence/** folder
   - Screenshots showing reality
   - Documentation proving limitations

**Remember: Scoop wins because it has BOTH powerful AI AND business user accessibility. Document both.**
