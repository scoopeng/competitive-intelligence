# Competitor Research Template V2 - Complete Protocol with Functionality Analysis

**Time**: 120-150 minutes for comprehensive, evidence-based competitive intelligence
**Quality**: Enterprise-grade with functionality mapping, implementation stories, quantified data, and research library
**Version**: 2.0 - Added Phase 2 Functionality Deep Dive

## üî¥ CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS

### 1. CHECK EXISTING RESEARCH FIRST
**Before running ANY search, check the Research Library section below to see if it's already been done**
- If a search is already documented with good results, SKIP IT (check the box and move on)
- If a search was done but returned no/poor results, you MAY retry it
- This prevents duplicate work and saves time

### 2. DOCUMENT AS YOU GO
**Document EVERY URL you visit in the appropriate phase research library file AS YOU GO**
- Create `evidence/phase[N]_research_library.md` for each phase
- Add each URL immediately after visiting to the appropriate phase file
- Include searches that return no results
- Update the main checklist summary after completing each phase

### 3. HANDLE EDGE CASES
- **Paywalled content**: Try cache:URL in Google, archive.org, or note as "Paywalled - could not access"
- **No results**: After 3 failed searches in a section, try broader terms or competitor's parent company
- **Time management**: If any phase exceeds time limit, prioritize high-value searches
- **Conflicting evidence**: Document both viewpoints in NOTES section with sources

### 4. RESEARCH LIBRARY ORGANIZATION
**All research is stored in separate files for better organization:**
- **Phase 1**: Create `evidence/phase1_research_library.md` (Customer Discovery)
- **Phase 2**: Create `evidence/phase2_functionality_analysis.md` (What It Actually Does)
- **Phase 3**: Create `evidence/phase3_technical_reality.md` (Technical Deep Dive)
- **Phase 4**: Create `evidence/phase4_sales_enablement.md` (BUPAF & Materials)
- **In main checklist**: Reference each file with 5-8 key findings summary
- **Benefit**: Keeps checklist clean and research fully documented
