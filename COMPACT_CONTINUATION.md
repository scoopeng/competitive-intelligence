   - Real ML but $140K+/year
   - 2-4 week implementation
   - Requires data teams
7. **Tellius** - 85% complete
   - Real root cause analysis

## üéØ Remaining Competitors to Research

### High Priority (Should complete next)
- **Sisense** - Claims "AI-driven analytics" (likely Tier 1)
- **Domo** - Heavy AI marketing (likely Tier 1)
- **MicroStrategy** - Recent "AI" additions (likely Tier 1)

### Medium Priority
- **Databricks** - Has real ML but very technical (Tier 3)
- **Alteryx** - AutoML platform (Tier 3)
- **Palantir Foundry** - Powerful but enterprise-only (Tier 3)

### Lower Priority
- **H2O.ai** - Extremely technical (Tier 3)
- **C3 AI** - Massive implementation (Tier 3)
- **Akkio** - Claims no-code AI (investigate tier)
- **Obviously AI** - AutoML for business (investigate tier)
- **Pecan AI** - Predictive analytics focus (investigate tier)

## Key Patterns Discovered

### Tier 1 "AI Pretenders" (50% of researched)
- NO real ML/AI - just rules, alerts, or chat-to-SQL
- Tools for BI teams, not business users
- Generate formulas/charts, not insights
- Require portals (not Slack)
- Hidden massive costs ($54K-$340K/year)

### Tier 2 "Accessible AI" (12.5% - DataGPT only)
- Has real AI AND business user adoption
- BUT very limited features (single-source queries only)
- Missing: multi-dataset, predictive ML, Slack, PowerPoint, data prep
- Proves market need but shows execution matters

### Tier 3 "Real AI but Inaccessible" (37.5% of researched)
- REAL ML/AI capabilities
- BUT requires data teams and expertise
- Enterprise pricing ($100K-$300K+/year)
- 2-4 weeks to 6 months implementation
- 10-20% adoption due to complexity

## DataGPT Deep Dive (Important Finding)

**Critical Update**: DataGPT is NOT the threat it initially appeared to be.

**What they have**:
- Fast query engine (100x speed)
- Good natural language interface
- 85% adoption in their portal

**What they're MISSING** (vs Scoop):
- ‚ùå Multiple dataset analysis
- ‚ùå Deep reasoning/investigation engine
- ‚ùå Predictive ML capabilities
- ‚ùå Slack integration
- ‚ùå PowerPoint generation
- ‚ùå Data preparation tools
- ‚ùå Advanced visualizations
- ‚ùå Real-time streaming
- ‚ùå Spreadsheet integration

**Positioning**: "DataGPT is a feature (fast queries), Scoop is a platform"

## Next Session Instructions

### 1. Read These First
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/dev/competitive-intelligence
cat START_HERE.md          # Magic prompt and approach
cat RESEARCH_GUIDE.md      # Detailed methodology
cat EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md   # Current findings summary
```

### 2. Check What's Been Done
```bash
# See all competitors researched
ls -la tier*/*/README.md

# Check progress on each
cat RESEARCH_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md
```

### 3. Continue Research
Priority order:
1. Get screenshots for existing competitors (all at 85%)
2. Research Sisense, Domo, MicroStrategy (likely Tier 1)
3. Investigate Databricks, Alteryx (confirmed Tier 3)
4. Explore new entrants (Akkio, Obviously AI, Pecan)

### 4. Create Output Deliverables
Options discussed:
- **Landscape table**: All competitors on one page
- **Battle cards**: One page per competitor
- **Tiered summaries**: Group by tier

## Important Context for Next Session

### Research Quality Standards
- Every competitor needs 15-20 source documents
- Capture positive AND negative findings
- Direct quotes and specific evidence required
- Focus on business user accessibility barriers
- Document missing features vs Scoop

### Scoop's Unique Position (Validated)
Only solution with ALL of:
1. Real ML/AI (investigation engine, predictive analytics)
2. Business user accessibility (Slack, no IT required)
3. Complete feature set (multi-dataset, PowerPoint, data prep, etc.)
4. Affordable pricing ($3,588/year)

### Sales Positioning Evolution
- Tier 1: "They have fake AI, we have real ML"
- Tier 2: "They're a feature, we're a platform"  
- Tier 3: "Same AI, 10x more accessible"

## Quick Restart Commands

```bash
# See project structure
tree /home/ubuntu/dev/competitive-intelligence -L 3

# Find specific competitor
find . -name "*sisense*" -o -name "*domo*"

# Search for keywords
grep -r "predictive" --include="*.md"

# Check recent work
ls -lt tier*/*/sources/*.md | head -20
```

## Time Investment
- 15+ hours invested so far
- ~2 hours per competitor for thorough research
- Estimate 10-15 more hours to complete all competitors

**Remember**: The goal is building a comprehensive library that proves Scoop is the ONLY solution combining real AI with true business user accessibility at an affordable price.
