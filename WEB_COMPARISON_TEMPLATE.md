**Universal Sections** (Always include):
- All sections without bracketed conditionals
- Core comparisons, costs, journey analysis
- Basic technical limitations and evidence

**Conditional Sections** (Include when relevant):
- **[FOR MAJOR VENDORS]**: Power BI, Tableau, Domo, ThoughtSpot
- **[FOR STARTUPS/SMALLER VENDORS]**: Tellius, Sisense, Zenlytic, DataChat
- **[FOR AI PRODUCTS]**: Power BI Copilot, Snowflake Cortex, Tableau Pulse
- **[FOR CONSUMPTION-BASED PRICING]**: Domo, Snowflake, cloud-based products
- **[IF APPLICABLE]**: Include only if you have this specific data/research

**Handling Missing Data**:
- If a section doesn't apply, omit it entirely
- If data is partially available, include what you have
- Mark unknowns as "{Not publicly available}" or "{Research needed}"
- Smaller competitors may have 80-100K chars instead of full 150K

## AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) Guidelines

### Content Creation Principles
1. **Direct Answers First**: Start sections with clear, extractable answers to common questions
2. **Hierarchical Structure**: Use clear H2→H3→H4 heading hierarchy for AI comprehension
3. **Conversational Language**: Write in natural, conversational tone (Flesch score 80-90)
4. **Evidence-Based Claims**: Every major claim needs a citation or proof point
5. **Schema Markup**: Include structured data markup for comparison, FAQ, and how-to content
6. **Question Clusters**: Group related questions together for topical authority
7. **Fresh Content**: Update every 3-6 months with new evidence and insights

### AEO Maturity Level: Target Level 4 (Pillar)
- **Content**: Comprehensive answer clusters for all buyer questions
- **Technical**: Full schema markup, optimized site structure
- **Authority**: Original research, proprietary frameworks (BUPAF), thought leadership
- **Measurement**: Track AI answer presence, share of voice, engagement metrics

- Reality: Dynamic exploration without predefinition
- Process: Ask → Investigate → Discover → Share
- Investigation: Multi-pass reasoning across all data
- Time to insight: 30 seconds for any question
- Example: "Why did revenue drop?" triggers 5-10 query investigation
