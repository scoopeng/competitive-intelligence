# Business User Power Analytics Framework (BUPAF)

**Version**: 2.0  
**Created**: January 2025  
**Last Updated**: January 2025  
**Purpose**: Evaluate analytics platforms based on business user empowerment, not technical capabilities  
**Evolution**: Framework designed to discover and capture new differentiators as they emerge  

## Core Philosophy

**Traditional evaluation asks**: "What can the platform do?"  
**BUPAF asks**: "What can a business user actually accomplish alone?"

This framework shifts focus from features to empowerment, from capabilities to independence, from potential to practical reality.

## The Four Dimensions of Business User Power

### Dimension 1: Independence (10 points)
*Can business users operate without technical help?*

#### Scoring Rubric:
- **0-2 points**: Complete IT dependency
  - Every action requires IT ticket
  - Business users are viewers only
  - No direct data access
  
- **3-4 points**: Heavy analyst support required  
  - Can view pre-built content
  - Limited modifications allowed
  - New questions need analyst
  
- **5-6 points**: Guided self-service
  - Can ask some questions independently
  - Within pre-defined boundaries
  - IT sets up, users consume

## The Paradigm Shift

**Old Way**: Evaluate platforms on technical capabilities  
**BUPAF Way**: Evaluate platforms on business user empowerment

This isn't about having ML or NLP or cloud architecture.  
It's about whether a marketing manager can discover customer segments without help.  
It's about whether a sales director can investigate pipeline changes during a meeting.  
It's about whether a CEO can get answers without calling IT.

**The revolution isn't in the technology. It's in who can use it.**
