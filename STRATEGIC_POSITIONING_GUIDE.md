## Core Message (Always Lead With This)

**"Scoop is your AI Data Analyst"**
- Multi-pass investigation (3-10 queries to find root cause)
- Explanatory ML (ML_GROUP/ML_PERIOD with J48/M5 Rules)
- Automatic schema evolution (no breaking on changes)
- 30-second setup (vs 3-4 months)

This is what gets them in the door. Never compromise this message.

## "Your Tools" Emphasis - Strategic Application

### ðŸŽ¯ HAMMER This Message Against These Competitors

#### Snowflake Cortex
**Primary Attack**: "They query your warehouse. We analyze in your Excel."
**Why Devastating**: They're trapped in SQL and Snowflake console
**Specific Pain**: Users must learn their query interface, export to CSV, import to Excel, clean data, create charts, screenshot to PowerPoint
**Time Comparison**: Their path = 3-4 hours. Our path = 30 seconds.
**Proof Point**: "Let me show you =SCOOP() working in Excel right now"

#### Zenlytic
**Primary Attack**: "They need YAML files. We need 30 seconds in Slack."
**Why Devastating**: YAML configuration is the opposite of business user empowerment
**Specific Pain**: Every new metric requires YAML editing by technical team
**Configuration Hell**: Show their YAML requirements vs our natural language
**Proof Point**: "Your team is already in Slack. Why make them learn another tool?"

#### DataGPT
**Primary Attack**: "They show metrics in their portal. We deliver answers in YOUR PowerPoint."
**Why Devastating**: Fast metrics are useless if you spend 3 hours getting them presentation-ready
**Specific Pain**: Screenshot â†’ Paste â†’ Annotate â†’ Format â†’ Repeat
**Speed Paradox**: "What's the point of 1-second queries if you need 3 hours for PowerPoint?"
**Proof Point**: Live demo of PowerPoint generation with brand colors

#### Sisense
**Primary Attack**: "Another portal to learn. We work in your Office suite."
**Why Devastating**: Portal fatigue is real - users already have 20+ logins
**Specific Pain**: Training costs, adoption friction, context switching
**Reality Check**: "How many portals do your users actually check daily?"
**Proof Point**: "Scoop works where they already are - Excel, PowerPoint, Slack"

### âš¡ Use as SUPPORTING Point Against These Competitors

#### Tableau & Power BI
**Lead With**: Investigation capabilities and ML analysis
**Then Add**: "Plus, no more screenshot-paste marathons for PowerPoint"
**Why Secondary**: They have strong visualization, so attack their weakness (no investigation)
**Supporting Message**: "Even if they could investigate (they can't), you'd still waste hours on PowerPoint"

#### Thoughtspot
**Lead With**: True business user independence (no search syntax to learn)
**Then Add**: "And it works in your Excel, not just their portal"
**Why Secondary**: They claim business user focus, so differentiate on depth
**Supporting Message**: "Search is nice, but investigation in YOUR tools is better"

#### Domo
**Lead With**: Investigation depth (they do single queries only)
**Then Add**: "Without being trapped in the Domo portal"
**Why Secondary**: They have decent self-service claims
**Supporting Message**: "Business users shouldn't need to leave Excel to get answers"

## The Math That Matters

### Time Savings by Competitor Type

**NL-SQL Tools** (Snowflake, Zenlytic, DataGPT):
- Their path: Query â†’ Export â†’ Excel â†’ Clean â†’ Chart â†’ PowerPoint = 3-4 hours
- Scoop path: Ask â†’ Get answer in your tool = 30 seconds
- **Weekly savings**: 17.5 hours per user

**Enterprise BI** (Tableau, Power BI):
- Their path: Dashboard â†’ Screenshot â†’ PowerPoint â†’ Format = 2-3 hours  
- Scoop path: Ask â†’ Auto-generate presentation = 30 seconds
- **Weekly savings**: 12.5 hours per user

**Portal-Based** (Domo, Sisense, Thoughtspot):
- Their path: Login â†’ Navigate â†’ Export â†’ Excel â†’ PowerPoint = 2-3 hours
- Scoop path: Ask in Slack/Excel â†’ Done = 30 seconds
- **Weekly savings**: 12.5 hours per user

## Key Phrases by Competitor

### Snowflake Cortex
"Why query in their console when you can analyze in your Excel?"

### Zenlytic
"YAML files or 30 seconds in Slack - which sounds more business-friendly?"

### DataGPT  
"Metrics in their portal or answers in your PowerPoint?"

### Tableau/Power BI
"They visualize what happened. We investigate why - in your tools."

### Domo
"Portal prison or Excel freedom?"

### Thoughtspot
"Search their portal or investigate in your Excel?"

### Sisense
"Another login to remember or analytics where you already work?"

---

## Objection Handling

### "We already have Excel exports"
**Response**: "Exports die on arrival. =SCOOP() formulas refresh live. Show me any BI tool that can do that."

### "Our users can learn a new portal"
**Response**: "They can, but will they? 87% of BI projects fail due to adoption. We work where they already are."

### "We need advanced visualizations"
**Response**: "Scoop has pixel-perfect visualizations PLUS live PowerPoint generation with your brand colors. But more importantly, we investigate WHY things happen, not just show pretty charts."

## The Universal Truth

**Every competitor** = Another portal/interface to learn  
**Scoop** = Your AI analyst in tools you already know

This isn't about features. It's about meeting business users where they actually work.

## Remember

- Against NL-SQL: "Your tools" is the PRIMARY attack
- Against Enterprise BI: "Your tools" SUPPORTS investigation/ML message
- Always demonstrate, don't just describe
- Time savings math closes deals
- Business users hate learning new tools - use this
