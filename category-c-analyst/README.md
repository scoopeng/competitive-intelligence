# Category C: Analyst Workbenches (19-32 points)

**Definition**: Platforms with real capabilities but requiring technical expertise or significant setup.

## Current Members
- **DataGPT** (25/50) - Fast but schema-rigid after setup
- **Domo** (23/50) - Dashboard-first with consumption pricing
- **ThoughtSpot** (23/50) - Real AI with 33.3% accuracy issues
- **Tellius** (20/50) - Genuine ML requiring data scientists
- **Zenlytic** (18/50) - YAML/SQL configuration required

## Common Characteristics

### Strengths
- Some legitimate technical capabilities
- Real companies with real products
- Actual customers (though limited adoption)
- Some analytical depth

### Weaknesses
- **Technical dependency**: Require IT/data teams
- **No schema flexibility**: Break on data changes
- **High costs**: $60K-300K annually typical
- **Long implementations**: 2-12 months common
- **Limited adoption**: Business users struggle

## Why They're Not Category A

### The Technical Barrier
Every platform in this category requires:
- Data engineers or IT support
- Extensive configuration
- Pre-built models or dashboards
- Technical knowledge from users
- Ongoing maintenance

### The Investigation Gap
None can:
- Test multiple hypotheses automatically
- Perform multi-pass reasoning
- Find root causes independently
- Work across data sources seamlessly

## Competitive Positioning

### Against Each Other
These platforms compete on:
- Depth of technical features
- Industry specialization
- Price points (all expensive)
- Implementation speed (all slow)

### Against Scoop
They universally lose on:
- Business user accessibility
- Setup time (months vs seconds)
- Total cost (40-80x higher)
- Schema flexibility (none vs automatic)
- Investigation capability (none vs multi-pass)

## Sales Approach
When competing against Category C:
1. Acknowledge their technical capabilities
2. Focus on business user accessibility gap
3. Highlight total cost of ownership
4. Demonstrate investigation vs single queries
5. Show schema evolution advantage
